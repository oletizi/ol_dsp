# Release Process

This document describes the happy path for releasing packages in the audio-tools monorepo.

## Quick Reference

**One-click ship (truly one command):**
```bash
pnpm release:ship
```

This does EVERYTHING automatically:
- Auto-creates changeset if none exist (patch bump for all packages)
- Bumps versions
- Updates README.md files with new version
- Builds all packages
- Commits and pushes changes
- **Creates GitHub release with installer**
- Publishes to npm

**No manual steps required!** The installer will be immediately available at the URL in the README.

## Alpha Release Process (Happy Path)

### 1. Enter Alpha Mode (First Time Only)

```bash
pnpm release:pre:alpha
```

This puts changesets into prerelease mode. You only need to do this once when starting alpha releases.

**Output:**
```
ðŸ¦‹  Entered pre mode!
```

### 2. Ship It! ðŸš€

```bash
pnpm release:ship
```

**What this does (in order):**
1. **Auto-creates changeset** if none exist (all packages, patch bump)
2. **Bumps versions** from changesets: `pnpm changeset:version`
   - Reads `.changeset/*.md` files
   - Updates all `package.json` versions
   - Updates `CHANGELOG.md` files
   - **Updates README.md files with new version** (automated!)
   - Deletes processed changeset files
3. **Builds** all packages: `pnpm -r build`
4. **Stages** changes: `git add .`
5. **Commits** with message: `chore(release): publish packages`
6. **Pushes** to remote: `git push`
7. **Creates GitHub release**: `tsx scripts/create-github-release.ts`
   - Creates release tag `audio-tools@VERSION`
   - Uploads installer script as `install.sh`
   - Generates and uploads `install.sh.sha256` checksum
   - Adds release notes with installation instructions
8. **Publishes** to npm: `pnpm changeset:publish`

**You will be prompted for:**
- 2FA/OTP code from your authenticator app

**Expected output:**
```
ðŸ¦‹  info Publishing "@oletizi/package-name" at "1.0.1-alpha.1"
ðŸ¦‹  success packages published successfully:
ðŸ¦‹  @oletizi/package-name@1.0.1-alpha.1
```

### 4. Verify Publication

```bash
npm view @oletizi/sampler-lib dist-tags
npm view @oletizi/sampler-export dist-tags
npm view @oletizi/audiotools dist-tags
```

**Expected output:**
```
{ latest: '1.0.0', alpha: '1.0.1-alpha.1' }
```

## Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# One-time setup: Enter alpha mode
pnpm release:pre:alpha

# That's it! Just run:
pnpm release:ship
# Enter your 2FA/OTP when prompted

# Verify it worked
npm view @oletizi/sampler-lib dist-tags
```

**Optional: Create custom changeset before shipping**

If you want a custom changeset message instead of "Automated release":

```bash
pnpm changeset
# Select packages and bump type, write description

# Then ship
pnpm release:ship
```

## Version Consistency

All packages should share the same version number for simplicity.

**To sync versions:**
1. Create changeset with all packages listed
2. Use same bump type for all (usually `patch`)
3. Run `pnpm release:ship`
4. All packages will have matching versions

## Exiting Alpha Mode

When ready to publish stable releases:

```bash
pnpm release:pre:exit
```

**What this does:**
- Exits prerelease mode
- Next `changeset version` will create stable versions (no `-alpha.X` suffix)
- Publishes to `latest` dist-tag instead of `alpha`

## Stable Release Process

```bash
# Ensure you've exited prerelease mode
pnpm release:pre:exit

# Create changeset
pnpm changeset

# Ship it! (version bump + build + commit + push + publish)
pnpm release:ship
```

## Troubleshooting

### "This operation requires a one-time password"
**Solution:** Enter your 6-digit 2FA code from your authenticator app.

### "Package not found" after publishing
**Solution:** Wait 1-2 minutes for npm CDN propagation, then check again.

### Versions out of sync
**Solution:** Create a changeset that includes all packages with the same bump type.

### Wrong dist-tag
**Issue:** Package published to `latest` instead of `alpha`
**Cause:** Package has never had a stable release
**Solution:** This is expected behavior. The package will use `alpha` dist-tag once a stable version exists.

## Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pnpm release:ship` | **One-click:** Version bump + update docs + build + commit + push + publish |
| `pnpm release:publish` | Version + build + publish (no git operations) |
| `pnpm changeset` | Create a new changeset interactively |
| `pnpm changeset:version` | Bump versions and update docs (called by release:ship) |
| `pnpm changeset:publish` | Publish to npm (only) |
| `pnpm update-docs` | Manually update README versions (rarely needed) |
| `pnpm release:pre:alpha` | Enter alpha prerelease mode |
| `pnpm release:pre:beta` | Enter beta prerelease mode |
| `pnpm release:pre:exit` | Exit prerelease mode |

## Best Practices

1. **Always create changesets** - Don't manually edit package.json versions
2. **Keep versions in sync** - Include all packages in each changeset
3. **Use descriptive changeset names** - `fix-sampler-export.md`, not `changeset-1.md`
4. **Verify before shipping** - Run `pnpm test` first
5. **Check dist-tags** - Verify packages published to correct tag
6. **Git hygiene** - Ensure branch is clean before shipping
7. **Exclude sampler-attic** - This package is marked private and won't publish

## Emergency Rollback

If you published a bad version:

```bash
# Deprecate the bad version
npm deprecate @oletizi/package-name@1.0.1-alpha.1 "Broken release, use 1.0.1-alpha.2"

# Tag a previous version as alpha
npm dist-tag add @oletizi/package-name@1.0.1-alpha.0 alpha
```

Then fix the issue and publish a new version.
