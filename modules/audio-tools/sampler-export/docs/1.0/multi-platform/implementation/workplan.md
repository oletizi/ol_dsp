| darwin-arm64 | 190 KB | mtools 4.0.49 | (system libs) | ✅ Verified |
| darwin-x64 | - | - | - | ⚠️ Still needed |

**Total Binary Size:** 0.58 MB (well under 5MB target)

**Binary Information:**
- **linux-x64**: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, dynamically linked, stripped
  - BuildID: 34c05c42794ab09976f09d0b8ed37fab3b7c4a94
  - Target: GNU/Linux 3.2.0+
  - Only depends on glibc (widely compatible)

- **linux-arm64**: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, ARM aarch64, dynamically linked, stripped
  - BuildID: 3a41594b60dbbd29372ffa9205c773e73cff29c8
  - Target: GNU/Linux 3.7.0+
  - Only depends on glibc (widely compatible)

- **darwin-arm64**: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
  - Version 4.0.49 (newer than Linux builds)

- test-binaries.sh has minor chmod issue in Docker (binaries mounted read-only), but binaries execute correctly

### Phase 2: Integration - COMPLETED ✓

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-07

**What was done:**
1. Verified git tracking status of all binaries
2. Added linux-x64 and linux-arm64 binaries to git
3. Confirmed package.json already includes bin/ directory in files array
4. Verified npm pack includes all three platform binaries
5. Updated bin/mtools/README.md with complete documentation for all platforms
6. Added SHA256 checksums for all binaries
7. Documented build process and binary sources

**Git Tracking:**
- All three binaries now tracked in git:
  - bin/mtools/darwin-arm64/mcopy ✅
  - bin/mtools/linux-x64/mcopy ✅
  - bin/mtools/linux-arm64/mcopy ✅

**Package Verification:**
- npm pack --dry-run confirmed all binaries included

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Binary Acquisition

#### Task 1.1: Build Linux Binaries with Docker (Recommended)

**Use automated build script:**
```bash
cd sampler-export/docs/1.0/multi-platform/implementation
./build-binaries.sh
```

**Script does:**
1. Uses Docker multi-platform builds for Linux x64 and ARM64
2. Extracts mcopy binary from Ubuntu 22.04 containers
3. Checks binary info and dependencies
4. Validates total package size

**Manual Docker build (if needed):**
```bash
# Linux x64
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/output ubuntu:22.04 \
  bash -c "apt update && apt install -y mtools && cp /usr/bin/mcopy /output/"

# Linux ARM64
docker run --rm --platform linux/arm64 \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/output ubuntu:22.04 \
  bash -c "apt update && apt install -y mtools && cp /usr/bin/mcopy /output/"
```

**Advantages:**
- Fast local iteration (no CI wait times)
- Easy debugging
- Reproducible builds
- Works on any machine with Docker

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] mcopy binary obtained for linux-x64 via Docker
- [x] mcopy binary obtained for linux-arm64 via Docker
- [x] Binary executes in target platform containers
- [x] Dependencies documented with `ldd`
- [x] Binary sizes documented

#### Task 1.2: Build/Acquire macOS Binaries

**macOS binaries cannot be cross-compiled in Docker** - must be built natively.

**For darwin-arm64 (current machine):**
```bash
brew install mtools
cp $(which mcopy) bin/mtools/darwin-arm64/mcopy
```

**For darwin-x64 (Intel Mac or CI):**

Option 1 - **Borrow Intel Mac:**
```bash
brew install mtools
cp $(which mcopy) bin/mtools/darwin-x64/mcopy
# Transfer via USB, AirDrop, or git
```

Option 2 - **GitHub Actions:**
```yaml
- runs-on: macos-13  # Intel runner
- run: brew install mtools
- run: cp $(which mcopy) artifacts/darwin-x64/
```

Option 3 - **Ask in community:**
- Post issue asking for darwin-x64 binary contribution
- Verify checksum before including

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] mcopy binary obtained for darwin-x64
- [ ] Binary executes on macOS Intel
- [ ] Binary size documented
- [ ] Source/build method documented

### Phase 2: Integration

#### Task 2.1: Add Binaries to Repository

**Steps:**
1. Create platform directories:
   ```bash

    "bin/mtools/darwin-x64",
    "bin/mtools/linux-x64",
    "bin/mtools/linux-arm64",
    "LICENSE"
  ]
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] package.json includes all binary directories (already included via "bin" entry)
- [x] npm pack includes binaries (verified with npm pack --dry-run)
- [x] Verify with: `npm pack && tar -tzf *.tgz | grep bin/mtools` (all three binaries present)

#### Task 2.3: Update Documentation

**Update `bin/mtools/README.md`:**
- Document all bundled platforms
- Add binary sizes
- Include source/build information
- Update license information if needed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] README.md updated with all platforms

- [x] License compliance verified (GPL-3.0)
- [x] SHA256 checksums included
- [x] Build process documented
- [x] Platform support status table added

### Phase 3: Testing

#### Task 3.1: Local Testing (Current Platform)

**Test on macOS ARM (current):**
```bash
pnpm --filter @oletizi/sampler-export build
node -e "console.log(require('./dist/utils/mtools-binary.js').getMcopyBinary())"
# Should return: .../bin/mtools/darwin-arm64/mcopy
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Binary detection works
- [ ] Extraction functionality works

#### Task 3.2: Cross-Platform CI Testing

**GitHub Actions workflow:**
```yaml
name: Multi-Platform Binary Test

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test-macos-intel:
    runs-on: macos-13
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm --filter @oletizi/sampler-export build
      - run: pnpm --filter @oletizi/sampler-export test

  test-linux-x64:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm --filter @oletizi/sampler-export build
      - run: pnpm --filter @oletizi/sampler-export test

  test-linux-arm64:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v2
      - uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
      - run: docker run --platform linux/arm64 ...
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] CI tests pass on all platforms
- [ ] Binary detection works on each platform
- [ ] Extraction functionality works

#### Task 3.3: Manual Platform Testing

**Test matrix:**
- [ ] macOS ARM (M1/M2/M3) - bundled binary
- [ ] macOS Intel - bundled binary
- [ ] Ubuntu 22.04 x64 - bundled binary
- [ ] Ubuntu 24.04 x64 - bundled binary
- [ ] Raspberry Pi (ARM64) - bundled binary
- [ ] Alpine Linux - fallback to system mtools
- [ ] macOS without binary - fallback to system mtools

**Test scenarios:**
1. Binary detection
2. DOS disk extraction
3. Batch extraction
4. Error messages when binary missing

### Phase 4: Package Size Validation

#### Task 4.1: Measure Package Size

**Check total size:**
```bash
npm pack
ls -lh *.tgz
# Target: < 5MB
```

**Breakdown by platform:**
```bash
tar -tzf *.tgz | grep bin/mtools | xargs -I {} sh -c 'tar -xzf *.tgz {} -O | wc -c'
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Total package size < 5MB (current: 0.58 MB)
- [x] Individual binary sizes documented
- [x] Size optimization if needed (strip, compression) - Not needed, already well under target

#### Task 4.2: Optimize if Needed

**If package > 5MB:**
1. Strip debug symbols:
   ```bash
   strip -S bin/mtools/*/mcopy
   ```

2. Compress binaries:
   ```bash
   # Consider gzip/brotli compression with runtime decompression
   ```

3. Consider alternative approaches:
   - Post-install download script
   - Separate platform-specific packages
   - Optional peer dependencies

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Package size meets < 5MB target (0.58 MB - no optimization needed)
- [x] Functionality preserved after optimization (binaries already stripped)

### Phase 5: Release Preparation

#### Task 5.1: Update CHANGELOG.md

**Add entry:**
```markdown

```

#### Task 5.2: Update ROADMAP.md

**Mark as complete:**
```markdown
## ✅ Cross-Platform Binary Support (Completed)

**Completed platforms:**
- [x] macOS Apple Silicon (darwin-arm64)
- [x] macOS Intel (darwin-x64)
- [x] Linux x64 (linux-x64)
- [x] Linux ARM64 (linux-arm64)
- [x] Fallback to system mtools if bundled binary unavailable
- [x] Package size < 5MB total

**Deferred:**
- [ ] Windows x64 (win32-x64) - Deferred to v2.0.0
```

#### Task 5.3: Version Bump and Publish

```bash
# Bump version
pnpm --filter @oletizi/sampler-export version patch

# Build
pnpm --filter @oletizi/sampler-export build

# Publish
pnpm --filter @oletizi/sampler-export publish
```

## Technical Considerations

### Binary Compatibility

**macOS:**
- Minimum OS version requirements
- Code signing (may require notarization for distribution)
- Gatekeeper bypass for unsigned binaries

**Linux:**
- glibc version compatibility (target Ubuntu 20.04+ / glibc 2.31+)
- musl libc support (Alpine Linux) - may need separate binary
- Dynamic library dependencies (prefer static linking)
- ✅ Current binaries built with Ubuntu 22.04 (glibc 2.35)
- ✅ Minimal dependencies (only libc.so.6 and ld-linux)

**ARM64:**
- Test on both 64-bit kernel and 32-bit userspace
- Raspberry Pi OS compatibility
- Performance on low-power ARM devices

### Security Considerations

1. **Binary verification:**
   - Document binary sources
   - Include checksums in README
   - Consider signing binaries
   - ✅ SHA256 checksums documented in README.md

2. **Supply chain:**
   - Use official package repositories
   - Document build process
   - Reproducible builds where possible
   - ✅ Build process documented and automated with Docker

3. **License compliance:**
   - mtools is GPL-licensed
   - Bundling requires GPL compliance
   - Document in LICENSE file
   - ✅ GPL-3.0 license documented in README.md

### Fallback Strategy

**When bundled binary unavailable:**
1. Check system PATH for mcopy
2. Provide clear installation instructions
3. Exit code 0 with warning (not error)
4. Continue with native Akai extraction only

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Zero-configuration installation on 4+ platforms (3/4 complete)
- [x] Package size < 5MB (0.58 MB achieved)
- [ ] CI tests pass on all platforms
- [ ] No user-reported binary issues for 2 weeks post-release
- [ ] 90%+ of users don't need to install mtools manually

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Package size > 5MB | Medium | Low | ✅ Not an issue - 0.58 MB |
| Binary compatibility issues | High | Medium | Extensive CI testing, fallback to system |
| GPL licensing concerns | High | Low | ✅ Legal review complete, proper attribution |
| Platform-specific bugs | Medium | Medium | User testing, quick patch release |
