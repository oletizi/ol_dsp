- Test result summary

**Usage:**
```bash
chmod +x tests/integration/routing_api_test.sh
./tests/integration/routing_api_test.sh [server_port]
```

## Build Configuration

### CMakeLists.txt Updates
Added `tests/unit/RouteManagerTest.cpp` to the `network_midi_tests` target at line 231:

```cmake
add_executable(network_midi_tests
    # ... other tests ...
    tests/unit/RouteManagerTest.cpp  # NEW
    # ... rest of tests ...
)
```

## Test Strategy

### Unit Test Approach
1. **Dependency Injection:** Uses real `DeviceRegistry` for realistic testing
2. **Isolation:** Each test creates fresh instances
3. **Thread Safety:** Validates concurrent access patterns
4. **Error Handling:** Tests all error paths
5. **Edge Cases:** Validates boundary conditions

### Integration Test Approach
1. **End-to-End:** Tests complete API workflow
2. **HTTP Protocol:** Validates REST endpoints
3. **State Management:** Verifies rule persistence
4. **Error Responses:** Checks proper HTTP status codes
5. **Automation:** Fully scripted with no manual steps

## Expected Test Results

### Unit Tests (via Google Test)
```bash
# Build and run unit tests
cmake --build build
./build/network_midi_tests --gtest_filter="RouteManagerTest.*"

# Expected output:
[==========] Running 42 tests from 1 test suite.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 42 tests from RouteManagerTest
...
[----------] 42 tests from RouteManagerTest (XX ms total)
[==========] 42 tests from 1 test suite ran. (XX ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 42 tests.
```

### Integration Tests (via Shell Script)
```bash
# Run integration tests
./tests/integration/routing_api_test.sh 8080

# Expected output:
[INFO] Starting Routing API Integration Tests
[INFO] Server: http://localhost:8080
...
========================================
Test Summary
========================================
Passed: 11
Failed: 0
Total:  11

All tests passed!
```

### Code Coverage
```bash
# Enable coverage and run tests
cmake -B build -DENABLE_COVERAGE=ON
cmake --build build
./build/network_midi_tests
make -C build coverage

# Coverage report: build/coverage/html/index.html
# Target: 80%+ coverage for RouteManager
```

## Test Dependencies

### Required for Unit Tests
- Google Test (already configured)
- Google Mock (already configured)
- JUCE framework
- C++17 compiler
- DeviceRegistry implementation

### Required for Integration Tests
- curl (HTTP client)
- jq (JSON parser, optional but recommended)
- Bash shell
- network_midi_server binary

## Coverage Gaps and Future Tests

### Potential Additional Tests (if needed)
1. **Performance Tests**
   - Large-scale rule sets (1000+ rules)
   - Rapid rule updates
   - High-frequency lookups

2. **Stress Tests**
   - Memory leak detection
   - Long-running stability
   - Resource exhaustion scenarios

3. **API Security Tests**
   - Malicious input handling
   - SQL injection (if using DB)
   - Buffer overflow protection

4. **Network Tests**
   - Connection timeout handling
   - Partial JSON handling
   - Large payload handling

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Build the project
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build

# 2. Run unit tests
./build/network_midi_tests --gtest_filter="RouteManagerTest.*"

# 3. Run integration tests (after implementation)
chmod +x tests/integration/routing_api_test.sh
./tests/integration/routing_api_test.sh 8080
```

### With Coverage
```bash
# 1. Build with coverage
cmake -B build -S . -DENABLE_COVERAGE=ON
cmake --build build

# 2. Run tests
./build/network_midi_tests

# 3. Generate coverage report
make -C build coverage

# 4. View report
open build/coverage/html/index.html
```

## Test Maintenance

### When to Update Tests
- Adding new RouteManager features
- Modifying rule validation logic
- Changing API endpoints
- Updating data structures
- Adding new filter types

### Test Review Checklist
- [ ] All new features have corresponding tests
- [ ] Error cases are covered
- [ ] Thread safety is validated
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Coverage remains above 80%
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] No test flakiness

## Notes
- Unit tests are designed to work with the RouteManager implementation once it's created
- Integration tests require the HTTP server endpoints to be implemented
- Both test suites follow the existing project patterns (RoutingTableTest, DeviceRegistryTest)
- Tests are compatible with the JUCE-based architecture
- All file paths are absolute as required by the project guidelines
