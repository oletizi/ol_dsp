# Phase 2: Routing Configuration API - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the core data structures implemented for Phase 2 of the cross-node MIDI routing system. These structures enable configuration and management of MIDI forwarding rules between devices across the mesh network.

## Files Created

### 1. ForwardingRule.h
**Location**: `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp-midi-server/modules/juce/midi-server/network/routing/ForwardingRule.h`
**Size**: 285 lines
**Purpose**: Complete header-only implementation of MIDI forwarding rules

#### Key Components:

**MidiMessageType Enum**
- Bitfield enum for filtering MIDI message types
- Supports: NoteOff, NoteOn, PolyAftertouch, ControlChange, ProgramChange, ChannelAftertouch, PitchBend, SystemMessage
- Bitwise operators for combining flags
- Default: All messages (0xFF)

**ChannelFilter Structure**
- Filters MIDI by channel (1-16, or 0 for all channels)
- JSON serialization support
- Validation for channel range

**ForwardingStatistics Structure**
- Tracks messages forwarded and dropped
- Records last forwarded timestamp
- JSON serialization support
- Reset functionality

**ForwardingRule Structure**
- Core routing rule with source and destination devices
- Uses DeviceKey for composite (nodeId, deviceId) addressing
- Priority system (higher = higher priority, default 100)
- Enable/disable flag
- Optional channel and message type filters
- Statistics tracking
- Full JSON serialization/deserialization
- Validation logic
- Filter matching for routing decisions

#### Design Decisions:

1. **Header-only implementation**: All code in .h file for simplicity and template-like usage
2. **Composite device keys**: Uses existing DeviceKey structure from Phase 1
3. **Priority-based routing**: Supports multiple rules per source with conflict resolution
4. **Optional filters**: Channel and message type filters can be omitted for "forward everything"
5. **Statistics tracking**: Built-in metrics for monitoring and debugging
6. **JSON serialization**: Uses JUCE's DynamicObject for clean JSON handling

### 2. RouteManager.h
**Location**: `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp-midi-server/modules/juce/midi-server/network/routing/RouteManager.h`
**Size**: 232 lines
**Purpose**: Thread-safe manager for forwarding rules

#### API Surface:

**Rule Management (CRUD)**
- `addRule(rule)` - Add new rule, auto-generate ID if needed
- `removeRule(ruleId)` - Remove by ID
- `updateRule(ruleId, rule)` - Update existing rule
- `getRule(ruleId)` - Get single rule
- `getAllRules()` - Get all rules
- `clearAllRules()` - Remove all rules

**Query Operations**
- `getDestinations(sourceNodeId, sourceDeviceId)` - Get destinations for a source (sorted by priority)
- `getSourceRules(nodeId, deviceId)` - Get rules with device as source
- `getDestinationRules(nodeId, deviceId)` - Get rules with device as destination
- `getEnabledRules()` - Get active rules only
- `getDisabledRules()` - Get inactive rules only
- `hasRule(ruleId)` - Check rule existence
- `getRuleCount()` - Get total rule count

**Validation**
- `validateRule(rule, errorMsg)` - Validate rule structure and device existence

**Persistence**
- `loadFromFile(file)` - Load rules from JSON file
- `saveToFile(file)` - Save rules to JSON file

**Statistics**
- `getStatistics()` - Aggregate statistics across all rules
- `resetStatistics()` - Clear all statistics
- `updateRuleStatistics(ruleId, forwarded)` - Update during message forwarding

#### Design Decisions:

1. **Thread-safe**: All operations protected by std::mutex
2. **Reference to DeviceRegistry**: Validates rules against actual devices
3. **Priority sorting**: getDestinations() returns rules sorted by priority for fast routing
4. **Preserves statistics**: updateRule() keeps existing statistics
5. **Error handling**: Throws std::runtime_error for invalid rules with descriptive messages
6. **UUID-based IDs**: Auto-generates UUIDs for stable rule references
7. **Type checking**: Validates source is "input" and destination is "output"

### 3. RouteManager.cpp
**Location**: `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp-midi-server/modules/juce/midi-server/network/routing/RouteManager.cpp`
**Size**: 415 lines
**Purpose**: Implementation of RouteManager

#### Implementation Highlights:

**Validation**
- Checks rule structure (non-empty ID, source != destination)
- Verifies source device exists in DeviceRegistry
- Verifies destination device exists in DeviceRegistry
- Validates source is type "input" (receives MIDI)
- Validates destination is type "output" (sends MIDI)
- Validates channel filter if present (0-16)

**Persistence**
- JSON array format for rules
- Replaces all rules on load (not merge)
- Pretty-printed JSON with indentation
- Error handling for file I/O failures

**Query Optimization**
- getDestinations() sorts by priority (highest first) for fast routing decisions
- Thread-safe iteration with lock guards
- Reserve capacity where possible to reduce allocations

**Statistics Management**
- Aggregates across all rules
- updateRuleStatistics() called from message forwarding path
- Thread-safe updates with mutex

## Integration Points

### Dependencies
- **DeviceRegistry**: Validates device existence
- **DeviceKey**: Uses existing composite key structure
- **JUCE**: Core, Time, JSON, File, Uuid

### Used By (Future)
- **HTTP Routing API**: Will expose CRUD endpoints
- **MidiRouter**: Will use getDestinations() for forwarding decisions
- **Rule UI**: Will use for configuration interface

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Recommended)
1. **ForwardingRule Tests**
   - JSON serialization round-trip
   - Filter matching (channel, message type)
   - Validation (source != destination, channel range)
   - Statistics tracking

2. **RouteManager Tests**
   - CRUD operations
   - Thread safety (concurrent access)
   - Validation against DeviceRegistry
   - Query operations (getDestinations priority sorting)
   - Persistence (save/load)
   - Statistics aggregation

### Integration Tests (Recommended)
1. **With DeviceRegistry**
   - Validate rules against actual devices
   - Handle device removal (orphaned rules)

2. **With MidiRouter**
   - Routing decisions based on rules
   - Statistics updates during forwarding

## Usage Example

```cpp
// Create device registry and route manager
DeviceRegistry registry;
RouteManager routeManager(registry);

// Add some devices
registry.addLocalDevice(1, "MIDI In", "input");
registry.addLocalDevice(2, "MIDI Out", "output");
registry.addRemoteDevice(remoteNodeId, 1, "Remote MIDI Out", "output");

// Create a forwarding rule
ForwardingRule rule(
    juce::Uuid::null(), 1,  // Local MIDI In (source)
    remoteNodeId, 1          // Remote MIDI Out (destination)
);
rule.priority = 100;
rule.channelFilter = ChannelFilter(1);  // Only channel 1
rule.messageTypeFilter = MidiMessageType::NoteOn | MidiMessageType::NoteOff;

// Add the rule
std::string ruleId = routeManager.addRule(rule);

// Query destinations for routing
auto destinations = routeManager.getDestinations(juce::Uuid::null(), 1);
for (const auto& dest : destinations) {
    if (dest.shouldForward(1, MidiMessageType::NoteOn)) {
        // Forward message to dest.destinationDevice
        routeManager.updateRuleStatistics(dest.ruleId.toStdString(), true);
    }
}

// Save rules to file
routeManager.saveToFile(juce::File("rules.json"));

// Get statistics
auto stats = routeManager.getStatistics();
std::cout << "Total rules: " << stats.totalRules << std::endl;
std::cout << "Messages forwarded: " << stats.totalMessagesForwarded << std::endl;
```

## Next Steps

1. **Unit Tests**: Create RouteManagerTest.cpp
2. **HTTP API**: Implement REST endpoints for CRUD operations
3. **Integration**: Hook into MidiRouter for actual message forwarding
4. **Persistence**: Decide on default rules file location
5. **Documentation**: Add API docs for HTTP endpoints

## Design Rationale

### Why Header-only ForwardingRule?
- Small, self-contained structure
- Inline JSON serialization for efficiency
- No need for separate compilation unit
- Similar to DeviceKey pattern in codebase

### Why Reference to DeviceRegistry?
- Validates rules against actual devices
- Prevents orphaned rules pointing to non-existent devices
- Enforces type constraints (input->output)
- Single source of truth for device state

### Why Priority System?
- Allows multiple rules per source
- Conflict resolution (which destination wins)
- Future: Load balancing, failover, multi-destination

### Why Statistics Tracking?
- Debugging: Which rules are actually used?
- Monitoring: Message throughput per rule
- Performance: Identify bottlenecks
- User feedback: Show active/inactive rules

### Why UUID-based Rule IDs?
- Stable references across saves/loads
- No ID collision issues
- URL-safe for HTTP API
- Easy to generate, no ID allocation needed

## Known Limitations

1. **No rule duplicate detection**: Can create identical rules with different IDs
2. **No rule naming**: Rules only identified by UUID (could add human-readable name)
3. **No rule groups**: Can't organize rules into logical groups
4. **No rule templates**: Can't create rule templates for reuse
5. **No automatic cleanup**: Orphaned rules when devices removed (future enhancement)
6. **No rule scheduling**: Can't enable/disable rules on schedule (future enhancement)
