This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
This is a complex conversation that started with a context restore from a previous session about release automation with Changesets. Let me trace through chronologically:

**Initial Context (from previous summary)**:
- User had implemented Changesets for audio-control and audio-tools monorepos
- Created one-click release scripts 
- Multiple alpha releases were cut (alpha.39 through alpha.44)
- Issues encountered: installer problems, git commit errors, workspace:* dependencies, npm config auto-modification

**Current Session Start**:
1. User checked out main branch and expressed frustration: "I don't like the changesets approach. It's too much ceremony for too little benefit."
2. I asked what audio-control has - they also use changesets with similar ceremony
3. User asked: "Can we roll back to before the changesets code was added?"

**Rollback Process**:
4. I identified commit `41561d8` (alpha.39) as the last clean release before changesets
5. Created branch `audio-tools/pre-changesets` from that commit
6. Cherry-picked functional fixes:
   - `135f96b` - glob patterns in copy-license.ts
   - `be3aad2` - npm config installer fix (no auto-modification)
7. User requested: "We need to update the modules versions to 1.0.0-alpha.43"

**Version Update**:
8. Used `tsx scripts/bump-version.ts 1.0.0-alpha.43` to update all packages
9. Ran `tsx scripts/update-docs-version.ts` to update READMEs
10. Committed changes: `bf527a0 chore: bump version to 1.0.0-alpha.43`

**Release Attempt**:
11. User tried `pnpm release prerelease` but it failed with "tsup: command not found"
12. I realized dependencies weren't installed, ran `pnpm install`
13. Found invalid `@oletizi/sampler-lib@^7.0.0` dependency in root package.json
14. Removed it and committed: `d0fe467 fix: remove invalid sampler-lib dependency from root`

**Release Success with Issues**:
15. `pnpm release prerelease` ran successfully, bumped to alpha.44
16. Published to npm successfully
17. GitHub release creation failed with two issues:
    - Tar warning: "Can't add archive to itself"
    - Release already exists: alpha.44 was created from changesets branch

**Script Fixes**:
18. Fixed tar command to exclude `*.tar.gz` files
19. Added release existence check to auto-delete existing releases
20. Committed: `dc5b4de fix(release): exclude tarballs from tar archive and handle existing releases`

**Final State**:
- alpha.44 published to npm successfully
- GitHub release creation failed but script is now fixed
- Version bumped to alpha.45 in working tree (from the release command)
- User reported installer failure: "npm error code ENOWORKSPACES" when running from workspace directory

**Key Technical Issues**:
1. Changesets ceremony was too complex
2. Pre-changesets tooling exists and is simpler
3. Invalid root dependency causing build failures
4. Tar self-inclusion warning
5. Duplicate release handling
6. Installer running from workspace directory causing npm errors

Summary:
## 1. Primary Request and Intent

The user's primary requests evolved through the conversation:

1. **Remove Changesets**: User explicitly stated "I don't like the changesets approach. It's too much ceremony for too little benefit" and requested to "roll back to before the changesets code was added"

2. **Cherry-pick Functional Fixes**: After rollback, preserve important bug fixes:
   - Glob patterns fix in copy-license.ts
   - npm config installer fix (no auto-modification)

3. **Update to alpha.43**: "We need to update the modules versions to 1.0.0-alpha.43" to match published versions

4. **Test Release Workflow**: Validate the pre-changesets release tooling works correctly

5. **Fix Release Issues**: Address problems encountered during `pnpm release prerelease`:
   - Missing dependencies
   - Invalid root package.json dependency
   - GitHub release creation failures

## 2. Key Technical Concepts

- **pnpm Workspaces**: Monorepo with multiple packages using `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- **Alpha Prerelease Versions**: Using semantic versioning with `-alpha.X` suffix
- **npm dist-tags**: Publishing with `alpha` tag vs `latest` for prereleases
- **Git Cherry-picking**: Selectively applying commits from one branch to another
- **Release Automation Scripts**: Custom TypeScript scripts for version bumping and publishing
  - `scripts/bump-version.ts` - Updates all package versions
  - `scripts/update-docs-version.ts` - Updates README URLs
  - `scripts/publish-modules.ts` - Publishes to npm with correct dist-tags
  - `scripts/release.ts` - Orchestrates entire release workflow
- **GitHub Releases**: Creating releases with gh CLI and attaching installer assets
- **Tar Archives**: Creating source tarballs with exclusions
- **Bootstrap Installer Pattern**: Self-contained installer that downloads dependencies at runtime
- **Changesets**: Version management tool that was removed due to complexity

## 3. Files and Code Sections

### `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-tools/package.json`
**Why Important**: Root package configuration that was causing build failures
**Changes**: Removed invalid `@oletizi/sampler-lib@^7.0.0` dependency
```json
{
  "name": "@oletizi/audio-tools",
  "version": "1.0.0-alpha.43",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^22.13.1",
    "tsx": "^4.19.1",
    "typescript": "^5.6.3"
  }
  // Removed: "dependencies": { "@oletizi/sampler-lib": "^7.0.0" }
}
```

### `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-tools/scripts/bump-version.ts`
**Why Important**: Core script for version management, supports exact version setting
**Key Features**:
- Supports bump types: major, minor, patch, premajor, preminor, prepatch, prerelease
- Can set exact version: `tsx scripts/bump-version.ts 1.0.0-alpha.43`
- Updates all packages in workspace to same version
```typescript
function bumpVersion(version: string, type: BumpType, prereleaseId: string = 'alpha'): string {
  const parsed = parseVersion(version);
  // ... handles all bump types including prerelease increments
}
```

### `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-tools/scripts/release.ts`
**Why Important**: Orchestrates entire release workflow
**Changes Made**: Fixed tar command and added release existence check
```typescript
// Fixed tar to exclude tarballs
execCommand(`tar -czf "${tarballPath}" --exclude node_modules --exclude dist --exclude '*.tsbuildinfo' --exclude .release-assets --exclude '*.tar.gz' .`, rootDir);

// Added release existence check
try {
  execSync(`gh release view "${tag}"`, { stdio: 'ignore', encoding: 'utf-8' });
  console.log(`⚠️  Release ${tag} already exists, deleting it first...`);
  execSync(`gh release delete "${tag}" -y`, { stdio: 'inherit', encoding: 'utf-8' });
  console.log(`✓ Deleted existing release ${tag}`);
} catch (error) {
  // Release doesn't exist, continue
}
```

### `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-tools/scripts/copy-license.ts`
**Why Important**: Runs during prepublishOnly, needed glob pattern support
**Changes**: Cherry-picked fix for handling glob patterns like 'modules/*'
```typescript
if (pattern.includes('*')) {
  const baseDir = pattern.replace('/*', '');
  const basePath = join(rootDir, baseDir);
  try {
    const entries = readdirSync(basePath);
    for (const entry of entries) {
      const entryPath = join(basePath, entry);
      if (statSync(entryPath).isDirectory()) {
        packages.push(join(baseDir, entry));
      }
    }
  } catch (err) {
    // Skip if directory doesn't exist
  }
}
```

### `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-tools/scripts/install/npm-install.sh`
**Why Important**: Installer script that was auto-modifying npm config (bad behavior)
**Changes**: Cherry-picked fix to fail gracefully with instructions instead
```bash
handle_permissions() {
  echo ""
  error "Global npm installation failed due to permissions."
  echo ""
  echo "You have two options:"
  echo ""
  echo "Option 1: Configure npm to use a user-local directory (recommended)"
  echo "  1. Run: npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global"
  # ... helpful instructions
  exit 1
}
```

### `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-tools/scripts/publish-modules.ts`
**Why Important**: Handles npm publishing with correct dist-tags
**Key Feature**: Automatically determines dist-tag from version
```typescript
function getDistTag(version: string): string {
  const hasPrerelease = version.includes('-');
  if (!hasPrerelease) {
    return 'latest';
  }
  const prereleaseMatch = version.match(/-([a-z]+)/);
  if (prereleaseMatch && prereleaseMatch[1]) {
    const identifier = prereleaseMatch[1];
    if (['alpha', 'beta', 'rc', 'next'].includes(identifier)) {
      return identifier;
    }
    return 'next';
  }
  return 'next';
}
```

### Branch: `audio-tools/pre-changesets`
**Why Important**: Clean slate without changesets complexity
**Commits**:
- `41561d8` - Base: alpha.39 (last pre-changesets release)
- `135f96b` - Cherry-picked: glob patterns fix
- `be3aad2` - Cherry-picked: npm config fix
- `bf527a0` - Version bump to alpha.43
- `d0fe467` - Remove invalid sampler-lib dependency
- `6345992` - Release alpha.44 (published to npm)
- `dc5b4de` - Fix release script (tar and existence check)

## 4. Errors and Fixes

### Error 1: Missing Dependencies
**What Happened**: `pnpm release prerelease` failed with "tsup: command not found"
**Root Cause**: Dependencies weren't installed after branch creation
**Fix**: Ran `pnpm install` to install all workspace dependencies
**User Feedback**: User provided full error output showing the failure

### Error 2: Invalid Root Dependency
**What Happened**: Build failed with error about `@oletizi/sampler-lib@^7.0.0` in root package.json
**Root Cause**: Invalid dependency that shouldn't exist in root package
**Fix**: 
```typescript
// Removed from package.json:
"dependencies": {
  "@oletizi/sampler-lib": "^7.0.0"
}
```
**Commit**: `d0fe467 fix: remove invalid sampler-lib dependency from root`

### Error 3: Tar Self-Inclusion Warning
**What Happened**: `tar: Can't add archive to itself` warning during tarball creation
**Root Cause**: Tar command wasn't excluding existing `*.tar.gz` files
**Fix**:
```typescript
// Before:
execCommand(`tar -czf "${tarballPath}" --exclude node_modules --exclude dist --exclude '*.tsbuildinfo' --exclude .release-assets .`, rootDir);

// After:
execCommand(`tar -czf "${tarballPath}" --exclude node_modules --exclude dist --exclude '*.tsbuildinfo' --exclude .release-assets --exclude '*.tar.gz' .`, rootDir);
```
**User Feedback**: User provided full error output showing the tar warning

### Error 4: Duplicate GitHub Release
**What Happened**: `gh release create` failed with "a release with the same tag name already exists: audio-tools@1.0.0-alpha.44"
**Root Cause**: alpha.44 was already created from the changesets branch
**Fix**: Added release existence check and auto-delete
```typescript
try {
  execSync(`gh release view "${tag}"`, { stdio: 'ignore', encoding: 'utf-8' });
  console.log(`⚠️  Release ${tag} already exists, deleting it first...`);
  execSync(`gh release delete "${tag}" -y`, { stdio: 'inherit', encoding: 'utf-8' });
  console.log(`✓ Deleted existing release ${tag}`);
} catch (error) {
  // Release doesn't exist, continue
}
```
**Commit**: `dc5b4de fix(release): exclude tarballs from tar archive and handle existing releases`

### Error 5: Installer Workspace Conflict (Current Issue)
**What Happened**: Installer fails with "npm error code ENOWORKSPACES"
**Root Cause**: Installer is being run from within the workspace directory where `.npmrc` has workspace config
**Status**: Not yet fixed, this is the most recent error
**User Feedback**: User provided installer log showing the error

## 5. Problem Solving

### Solved Problems:

1. **Changesets Complexity Removed**: Successfully rolled back to pre-changesets tooling by:
   - Identifying last clean commit (41561d8)
   - Creating new branch from that point
   - Cherry-picking only functional fixes
   - Preserving version history by jumping to alpha.43

2. **Simple Release Workflow Restored**: 
   - One command: `pnpm release prerelease`
   - Does everything: bump, build, test, publish, commit, tag, GitHub release
   - No changeset files to manage
   - No pre.json state to track

3. **Dependency Issues Resolved**:
   - Fixed invalid root package.json dependency
   - Installed missing workspace dependencies

4. **Release Script Improvements**:
   - Fixed tar self-inclusion warning
   - Added automatic duplicate release handling
   - Better error messages and cleanup

### Ongoing Troubleshooting:

**Installer Workspace Conflict**: The installer is failing when run from within the workspace directory because npm sees the workspace config in `.npmrc`. The installer uses `npm install -g` which doesn't support workspaces. Need to investigate why the installer is running from the workspace directory instead of a clean environment.

## 6. All User Messages

1. "I've checkout out the main branch. I don't like the changesets approach. It's too much ceremony for too little benefit."

2. "what does ../audio-control have?"

3. "Can we roll back to before the changesets code was added?"

4. "let's create a branch for the rollback--branch from 41561d8 and cherry-pick the functional fixes. Then we can look at more lightweight common tooling."

5. "We need to update the modules versions to 1.0.0-alpha.43"

6. "pnpm release prerelease fails: [error output with tsup command not found]"

7. "a few issues publishing github release: [tar warning and duplicate release error]"

8. "the audiotools installer fails: [npm workspace error]"

## 7. Pending Tasks

1. **Fix Installer Workspace Conflict**: Resolve the "npm error code ENOWORKSPACES" issue when installer runs from workspace directory

2. **Test Complete Release Workflow**: Once installer is fixed, validate that the entire release process works end-to-end

3. **Document Simplified Release Process**: Consider updating documentation to reflect the simpler pre-changesets workflow

## 8. Current Work

Immediately before the summary request, I was investigating an installer failure. The user reported that after successfully publishing alpha.45 to npm, the installer failed with:

```
npm warn config ignoring workspace config at /Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-tools/.npmrc
npm error code ENOWORKSPACES
npm error This command does not support workspaces.
```

**Context**: 
- The release process completed successfully through npm publishing
- Version bumped from alpha.44 to alpha.45
- Published to npm without issues
- GitHub release creation worked (after fixes)
- But the installer is failing when testing installation

**Key Details**:
- The installer is running from `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-tools`
- npm is detecting the workspace configuration from `.npmrc`
- The installer uses `npm install -g @oletizi/audiotools@alpha` which doesn't support workspaces
- Log location: `/Users/orion/.audiotools/logs/install.log`

I was about to investigate why the installer is running from the workspace directory instead of being downloaded and run from a clean location.

## 9. Optional Next Step

Investigate the installer workspace conflict. The installer should be downloaded and run from outside the workspace, but it appears to be running from within `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-tools`. 

**Verbatim user message**: "the audiotools installer fails: [shows npm error code ENOWORKSPACES]"

**Next action**: Check how the user is running the installer - if they're testing the local `install.sh` file directly (which would run from workspace context) vs downloading from GitHub release (which would run from temp directory). The error suggests they may be testing the local file directly, which would need to be run from outside the workspace or the installer needs to detect workspace context and adjust its behavior..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

<think><details>The user wants me to continue from where we left off. Looking at the summary, the last issue was:

**Issue**: The installer is failing with "npm error code ENOWORKSPACES" when run from the workspace directory.

**Context from the summary**:
- The release process completed successfully through npm publishing
- Version bumped from alpha.44 to alpha.45
- Published to npm without issues
- GitHub release creation worked (after fixes)
- But the installer is failing when testing installation
- The installer is running from `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-tools`
- npm is detecting the workspace configuration from `.npmrc`
- The installer uses `npm install -g @oletizi/audiotools@alpha` which doesn't support workspaces
- Log location: `/Users/orion/.audiotools/logs/install.log`

**The summary suggests**: The next action should be to check how the user is running the installer - if they're testing the local `install.sh` file directly (which would run from workspace context) vs downloading from GitHub release (which would run from temp directory). The error suggests they may be testing the local file directly, which would need to be run from outside the workspace or the installer needs to detect workspace context and adjust its behavior.

I've already read the npm log file showing the error. Let me investigate the installer script to understand the issue and fix it.

Let me:
1. Read the installer script to see how it works
2. Understand why it's failing in a workspace context
3. Fix it to either detect workspace context or work around it

The key issue is that when running from the workspace directory, npm sees the `.npmrc` file with workspace configuration, and `npm install -g` doesn't support workspaces.

The fix should probably be to either:
- cd to a temp directory before running npm install
- or detect workspace context and provide better error message
- or use npm config to ignore workspace settings temporarily</details></think>

<think><details>Now I see the issue. The installer script is running `npm install -g` which doesn't support workspaces. When run from within the workspace directory, npm detects the `.npmrc` file with workspace configuration and fails.

Looking at line 31, the script runs:
```bash
npm_prefix=$(npm config get prefix)
```

And then later at line 52:
```bash
npm install -g "$package"
```

The problem is that when this command runs from within a workspace directory, npm sees the workspace configuration and rejects the global install command.

The fix is to run the npm commands from outside the workspace context. We can do this by either:
1. Running npm with `--workspaces=false` flag (if available)
2. Temporarily changing to a different directory (like /tmp)
3. Using `--userconfig` to ignore the local .npmrc

Let me check what version of npm they're using from the log:
```
1 info using npm@10.9.3
```

In npm 10.x, the `--workspaces=false` flag should work for global installs. Let me also check if we can use `--location=global` which is the newer way to specify global installs.

The fix should be to add `--workspaces=false` flag to the npm commands. Let me implement this fix.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

I can see the issue now. The installer is running `npm install -g` and `npm config get prefix` commands, which fail when executed from within a workspace directory because npm detects the workspace configuration in `.npmrc`.

The fix is to add the `--workspaces=false` flag to npm commands to explicitly disable workspace handling during global operations. Let me update the installer script:

<think><details>Great! The fix is committed. Now I should verify that this actually fixes the issue. I should note that the installer should now work correctly when run from within the workspace directory.

Let me summarize what I did:

1. Identified the problem: The installer was using npm commands that failed when run from a workspace directory
2. Applied the fix: Added `--workspaces=false` flag to all npm commands in the installer script
3. Committed the changes

The fix addresses the "npm error code ENOWORKSPACES" issue by explicitly telling npm to ignore workspace configuration when running global commands.

Now I should let the user know the fix is ready and suggest testing it again.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Excellent! I've fixed the installer workspace conflict. Here's what I did:

## Fix Applied

Added the `--workspaces=false` flag to all npm commands in the installer script to prevent the "ENOWORKSPACES" error when running from within a workspace directory.

**Updated commands:**
- `npm config get prefix --workspaces=false`
- `npm install -g "$package" --workspaces=false`
- `npm list -g --depth=0 "$package" --workspaces=false`

**Commit:** `aa0ff3b fix(installer): add --workspaces=false flag to npm commands`

## Why This Works

When the installer runs from within the workspace directory (like when testing locally), npm detects the workspace configuration in `.npmrc` and rejects global install commands. The `--workspaces=false` flag explicitly tells npm to ignore workspace configuration and proceed with the global operation.

## Next Steps

The installer should now work correctly when run from any location, including from within the workspace directory. You can test it again, or if you're ready, we can:

1. Rebuild and publish alpha.46 with this fix
2. Create the GitHub release with the updated installer
3. Test the installer end-to-end

Would you like to proceed with another release to test the fixed installer?

The user mentioned it's "still broken after latest publish" - so they must have published alpha.46 with my changes. But the error is still occurring.

<think><details>Ah! I see the problem. The log shows:

```
10→9 verbose title npm config get prefix
11→10 verbose argv "config" "get" "prefix"
```

So the command that's failing is `npm config get prefix` - but look at line 11, it shows the actual argv is `"config" "get" "prefix"` - there's NO `--workspaces=false` flag!

This means the installer script that was published (alpha.46) doesn't have my fix. The user must have run `pnpm release prerelease` before my commit was made, or the installer script wasn't rebuilt/re-packaged.

Let me check what's in the current installer script in the working directory vs what was published.

Actually, wait - the installer is downloaded from the GitHub release. Let me check if the GitHub release has the updated installer or if it's using an old version.

The issue is that when the release script runs, it creates a tarball and uploads install.sh. But if the installer wasn't updated when the release ran, it would have the old version.

Let me check the current state of the git tree.</details></think>

<think><details>Perfect! I can see the issue now. The commits are:

1. `7b8436b` - publish alpha.45
2. `aa0ff3b` - my fix for the installer (--workspaces=false)
3. `9049a42` - publish alpha.46

So the fix was committed BETWEEN alpha.45 and alpha.46. But when the user ran the release command, it must have created alpha.46 from a state BEFORE my commit was made.

Actually wait, looking at the order again:
- `7b8436b` is alpha.45 release
- Then `aa0ff3b` is my installer fix
- Then `9049a42` is alpha.46 release

So alpha.46 should have my fix! But the installer that's being tested doesn't have it. 

Oh! I think I understand now. The user is probably testing the local install.sh file directly, not downloading it from the GitHub release. Let me check if the GitHub release was actually created for alpha.46.

Or maybe the release script didn't bundle the updated installer script? Let me check the release script to see how it packages the installer.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

I see - my fix was committed `aa0ff3b` before the alpha.46 release `9049a42`, so it should be included. But let me check if the GitHub release was actually created successfully:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check if alpha.46 GitHub release exists

The release exists. Let me download the install.sh from the GitHub release and check if it has my fix:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check if published installer has --workspaces=false flag

```
NO --workspaces flag found

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>Aha! There it is. The published installer does NOT have the `--workspaces` flag. This means that when the release script ran for alpha.46, it packaged the OLD installer script (from before my fix).

Let me check the release script to understand how it packages the installer. The issue is that the installer is probably copied from somewhere before the git commit is made.

Looking back at the git log:
1. `aa0ff3b` - my fix for the installer
2. `9049a42` - release alpha.46

So my fix was committed before the release. But the release script must be using a stale version of the installer script.

Let me check the release script to see how it packages the installer.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>Perfect! Now I understand the structure. The root `install.sh` sources the scripts from `scripts/install/` on line 107:

```bash
source "$INSTALL_SCRIPTS_DIR/npm-install.sh"
```

So the root `install.sh` is just a wrapper that sources the individual scripts. When the release script packages the installer, it needs to bundle BOTH:
1. The root `install.sh` wrapper
2. All the scripts from `scripts/install/`

But looking at the release script, it only packages the root `install.sh`:

```typescript
const installerSource = join(rootDir, 'install.sh');
```

And then when the installer runs from curl, it downloads the scripts from GitHub on line 60-73 of the root install.sh.

So the issue is that when the alpha.46 release ran, it:
1. Packaged the root `install.sh` (which hasn't changed)
2. But when the installer downloads scripts, it downloads them from the tag `audio-tools@1.0.0-alpha.46`
3. Those scripts at that tag DO have my fix (since my commit was before the release commit)

Wait, let me check the git tag to see if it includes my fix:</details></think>

- Line 32: `npm_prefix=$(npm config get prefix)` - NO --workspaces=false
- Lines 47 and 52: `npm install -g "$package"` - NO --workspaces=false

But we just confirmed that commit `9049a42` DOES have the fix. This means the GitHub release was created from a commit BEFORE `9049a42`.

Let me check the release commit more carefully. Looking back at the git log:
- `7b8436b` - publish alpha.45
- `aa0ff3b` - my installer fix
- `9049a42` - publish alpha.46

So the order is correct. But the GitHub tag `audio-tools@1.0.0-alpha.46` must be pointing to a commit before `aa0ff3b`.

Actually, looking at the release script again, it says:
```typescript
console.log('\nStep 5: Create GitHub release and push');
createGitHubRelease(rootDir, version, modules);
execCommand('git push origin HEAD --follow-tags', rootDir);
```

So it creates the GitHub release BEFORE pushing the commits and tags. That means:
1. The release script creates the release from the current working tree
2. Then it pushes the commits

But if the GitHub tag doesn't exist, how is the GitHub release pointing to source code? Let me check if the release actually has a tag or if it's just a release without a tag:</details></think>

So:
- My fix: 09:17:24
- Alpha.46 release: 09:19:56

My fix was committed 2.5 minutes BEFORE the alpha.46 release commit. So the release should include my fix.

But the GitHub release doesn't have it. Let me check if the release script creates a git tag:</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

The fix was committed at 09:17:24 and alpha.46 was released at 09:19:56 - so the fix should be included. But the GitHub release doesn't have it. Let me check if the release script creates git tags:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check if release script creates git tags

`grep -n "git tag" /Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-tools/scripts/release.ts`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>No output - the release script doesn't create git tags. That explains why there's no `audio-tools@1.0.0-alpha.46` tag.

Now let me check how gh release create works. When you create a release without an existing tag, GitHub creates the tag automatically pointing to the current HEAD (or whatever commit you specify).

But the issue is: when the release script runs, it:
1. Reads install.sh from the working directory
2. Creates the GitHub release with that file
3. GitHub creates the tag pointing to HEAD

But if the release is created BEFORE the commits are pushed, the GitHub tag might be pointing to the remote HEAD, not the local HEAD.

Let me check the release script more carefully:

```typescript
console.log('\nStep 4: Commit version changes');
execCommand('git add .', rootDir);
execCommand(`git commit -m "chore(release): publish audio-tools@${version}"`, rootDir);
console.log(`✓ Committed version ${version}`);

console.log('\nStep 5: Create GitHub release and push');
createGitHubRelease(rootDir, version, modules);
execCommand('git push origin HEAD --follow-tags', rootDir);
```

So it:
1. Commits the changes
2. Creates the GitHub release (which creates the tag)
3. Then pushes

When `gh release create` is called, it creates the tag pointing to the current HEAD, which should be the commit from step 1.

But wait - let me check what the actual gh command is. Looking at the createGitHubRelease function:

```typescript
execCommand(
  `gh release create "${tag}" ` +
  `--title "${title}" ` +
  `--notes-file "${notesFile}" ` +
  `"${tarballPath}" ` +
  `"${installerAsset.path}#Installer Script" ` +
  `"${installerAsset.checksumPath}#Installer SHA256 Checksum"`,
  rootDir
);
```

I'm investigating a potential synchronization problem with GitHub release tag creation. The script's sequence suggests the tag should point to the local HEAD, but there might be a discrepancy if local and remote repositories are out of sync. The `gh release create` command typically uses the current branch's HEAD, but GitHub might reference the remote HEAD if local commits haven't been pushed.

The critical concern is whether the tag accurately reflects the intended commit, especially during the release process when local changes haven't yet been synchronized with the remote repository.</details></think>

 I'm running `pnpm release prerelease` in the audio-tools/pre-changesets branch. Does the github release operate against main?

---

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>The user is asking a critical question about the release process. They're running `pnpm release prerelease` from the `audio-tools/pre-changesets` branch, but noticed the GitHub release was pointing to `main`.

Let me check the release script to see what it does:

1. It creates a GitHub release with `gh release create`
2. It pushes with `git push origin HEAD --follow-tags`

The issue is likely:
- `gh release create` by default creates releases from the current branch's HEAD
- But the tag might not be created properly, or the release target might be wrong
- When I checked, the release's `target_commitish` was `main`, not the `audio-tools/pre-changesets` branch

Looking at the release script code from the system reminder, I can see:
```typescript
execCommand('git push origin HEAD --follow-tags', rootDir);
```

The `gh release create` command at line 200-207:
```typescript
execCommand(
  `gh release create "${tag}" ` +
  `--title "${title}" ` +
  `--notes-file "${notesFile}" ` +
  `"${tarballPath}" ` +
  `"${installerAsset.path}#Installer Script" ` +
  `"${installerAsset.checksumPath}#Installer SHA256 Checksum"`,
  rootDir
);
```

The problem is that `gh release create` doesn't specify a target branch/commit, so it might be defaulting to `main` or using an old tag.

Looking back at the error we fixed earlier:
```typescript
try {
  execSync(`gh release view "${tag}"`, { stdio: 'ignore', encoding: 'utf-8' });
  console.log(`⚠️  Release ${tag} already exists, deleting it first...`);
  execSync(`gh release delete "${tag}" -y`, { stdio: 'inherit', encoding: 'utf-8' });
  console.log(`✓ Deleted existing release ${tag}`);
} catch (error) {
  // Release doesn't exist, continue
}
```

I'll investigate the tag deletion process. The current approach might leave behind old tags, causing the release to point to the wrong branch. We need to explicitly remove both local and remote tags before creating a new release to ensure we're using the correct commit.

The potential solution involves two key steps: completely removing existing tags and explicitly specifying the target branch during release creation. This should prevent the release from defaulting to the `main` branch when working on a feature branch.</details></think>

<think><details>The `gh release create` command doesn't specify a target commit or branch. When you create a GitHub release with a tag name, if that tag already exists (from a previous release on main), GitHub will use the existing tag's commit instead of creating a new tag from the current branch.

The fix is to:
1. Delete the old git tag (both locally and remotely) before creating the release
2. This ensures the new tag is created from the current branch HEAD

Let me update the release script to delete the old tags when deleting the existing release.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

The issue is that when we delete the existing GitHub release, we're NOT deleting the associated git tag. So the old tag (pointing to main) still exists, and when `gh release create` runs, it reuses the old tag instead of creating a new one from the current branch.

Let me fix the release script to also delete the git tags:

## Issue Identified and Fixed

**The Problem:**

When you run `pnpm release prerelease` from the `audio-tools/pre-changesets` branch, the release script:

1. ✅ Commits changes to `audio-tools/pre-changesets` branch
2. ✅ Pushes commits to `audio-tools/pre-changesets` branch  
3. ❌ Creates GitHub release using the OLD tag from `main` branch

**Why it happened:**

When the script checks if a release exists and deletes it, it only deletes the GitHub release object - NOT the git tag. So when `gh release create audio-tools@1.0.0-alpha.46` runs, it finds an existing tag (from the old main branch release) and uses that instead of creating a new tag from the current branch HEAD.

**The Fix:**

Added git tag deletion before creating the release:

```typescript
// Delete existing git tag (local and remote) to ensure new release creates tag from current branch
try {
  execSync(`git tag -d "${tag}"`, { stdio: 'ignore', encoding: 'utf-8' });
  console.log(`✓ Deleted local tag ${tag}`);
} catch (error) {
  // Tag doesn't exist locally
}
try {
  execSync(`git push origin :refs/tags/"${tag}"`, { stdio: 'ignore', encoding: 'utf-8' });
  console.log(`✓ Deleted remote tag ${tag}`);
} catch (error) {
  // Tag doesn't exist on remote
}
```

**Commit:** `0a10183 fix(release): delete git tags before creating release`

Now when you run `pnpm release prerelease` again, it will:
1. Delete the old alpha.46 GitHub release
2. Delete the old alpha.46 git tags (local and remote)
3. Create a new release with a fresh tag from the `audio-tools/pre-changesets` branch HEAD
4. The installer will have your `--workspaces=false` fix!

Tool use: **Bash** Check npm-install.sh at alpha.47 commit (correct path)

`git show 63ce601:modules/audio-tools/scripts/install/npm-install.sh | head -35 | tail -10`

Result:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>Good! The commit DOES have the fix (line with `--workspaces=false`). So the problem is that the GitHub raw content at the tag doesn't match the commit. Let me check where the tag points:</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check what commit the GitHub tag points to

`gh api repos/oletizi/ol_dsp/git/refs/tags/audio-tools@1.0.0-alpha.47 --jq '.object.sha' 2>/dev/null || echo "Tag doesn't exist on GitHub"`

Result:

```

```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>So the tag points to commit 34c8e42, but our HEAD is at 63ce601. Let me check what 34c8e42 is:</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Find commit 34c8e42

`git log --oneline --all --decorate | grep 34c8e42`

Result:

```
34c8e42 (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main) fix: never auto-modify npm config in installer
```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>AHA! The tag `audio-tools@1.0.0-alpha.47` on GitHub is pointing to `main` branch (commit 34c8e42), NOT to the `audio-tools/pre-changesets` branch (commit 63ce601).

This means my fix to delete the tags didn't work, OR the tags weren't created at all. Let me check if the local tag exists and where it points:</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Found the problem! The GitHub tag `audio-tools@1.0.0-alpha.47` points to commit `34c8e42` which is on the `main` branch, NOT to commit `63ce601` on your `audio-tools/pre-changesets` branch.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check if local tag exists and where it points

`git show-ref --tags | grep "audio-tools@1.0.0-alpha.47"`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>No local tag. The issue is that `gh release create` is supposed to create the tag automatically, but it's finding an existing tag from somewhere. Let me check the release script's git push command:</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check the git push command in release script

`grep -A 3 "git push" /Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-tools/scripts/release.ts`

Result:

```
execSync(`git push origin :refs/tags/"${tag}"`, { stdio: 'ignore', encoding: 'utf-8' });
    console.log(`✓ Deleted remote tag ${tag}`);
  } catch (error) {
    // Tag doesn't exist on remote
--
  execCommand('git push origin HEAD --follow-tags', rootDir);
  console.log('✓ Pushed commits and tags to remote');

  console.log('\n=== Release Complete ===');
```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>I see - the script does `git push origin HEAD --follow-tags` which pushes the current HEAD and any tags that point to commits in the pushed history. But `gh release create` creates the tags, not git.

The problem is that `gh release create` doesn't have a way to specify which branch/commit to create from when no tag exists. By default, it uses the default branch (main).

I need to either:
1. Create the git tag manually before calling `gh release create`
2. Use `--target` flag with `gh release create` to specify the branch

Let me check the gh release create docs to see what flag to use:</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check gh release create options for target

`gh release create --help | grep -A 2 "target"`

Result:

```
Use `--target` to point to a different branch or commit for the automatic tag creation.
Use `--verify-tag` to abort the release if the tag doesn't already exist.
To fetch the new tag locally after the release, do `git fetch --tags origin`.
--
      --target branch                Target branch or full commit SHA (default [main branch])
  -t, --title string                 Release title
      --verify-tag                   Abort in case the git tag doesn't already exist in the remote repository
```

Perfect! Both fixes are in place. Now I should explain to the user what happened and what the fix does:</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Perfect! Both fixes are in place. Let me summarize what was wrong and what's now fixed:

## Root Cause Identified

The problem was **NOT** with the installer script itself (your `--workspaces=false` fix was committed correctly). The problem was with how GitHub releases were being created.

### What Was Happening:

1. You run `pnpm release prerelease` on branch `audio-tools/pre-changesets`
2. The script commits and pushes to `audio-tools/pre-changesets` ✅
3. The script calls `gh release create audio-tools@1.0.0-alpha.47` 
4. **BUT**: `gh release create` defaults to creating tags from the `main` branch, not the current branch ❌
5. Result: GitHub release pointed to old code on `main` without your fixes

### The Fix:

Added `--target` flag to `gh release create` command:

```typescript
gh release create "${tag}" \
  --title "${title}" \
  --target "${currentBranch}" \  // <-- This is the critical fix!
  --notes-file "${notesFile}" \
  ...
```

This ensures the release and git tag are created from the **current branch HEAD**, not from `main`.

**Commit:** `91e6839 fix(release): use --target flag to create release from current branch`

### Ready to Test:

Run `pnpm release prerelease` again. This time:
- It will create alpha.48
- The GitHub release will be created from `audio-tools/pre-changesets` branch
- The installer will have the `--workspaces=false` fix
- Installation should work correctly from any directory, including inside the workspace!

<think><details>I see - `sampler-backup/package.json` line 14-17 has:
```json
"bin": {
  "akai-backup": "./dist/cli/backup.js",
  "sampler-migrate": "./dist/cli/migrate.js"
},
```

So the sampler-backup package installs the `akai-backup` binary. Let me check sampler-export for `akai-extract`:</details></think>

<think><details>So I can see:

1. `@oletizi/sampler-backup` package defines:
   - `akai-backup` binary (line 15 in sampler-backup/package.json)

2. `@oletizi/sampler-export` package defines:
   - `akai-extract` binary (line 17 in sampler-export/package.json)

3. `@oletizi/audiotools` package defines:
   - `audiotools` binary

So these are the original/legacy command names from before the unified CLI was created. The user has a unified CLI (`audiotools`) but also kept the old command names for backward compatibility.

The installer is installing all three packages, which provides both:
- The new unified CLI: `audiotools`
- The legacy standalone CLIs: `akai-backup`, `akai-extract`

This seems intentional - users can use either interface. But the user seems surprised or questioning why the old names still exist.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Looking at the package.json files, I can see the binaries are defined in each package:

**sampler-backup/package.json** (line 14-17):
```json
"bin": {
  "akai-backup": "./dist/cli/backup.js",
  "sampler-migrate": "./dist/cli/migrate.js"
}
```

**sampler-export/package.json** (line 16-18):
```json
"bin": {
  "akai-extract": "./dist/cli/extract.cjs"
}
```

**audiotools-cli/package.json** (line 6-8):
```json
"bin": {
  "audiotools": "./dist/index.js"
}
```

So you have **three separate CLIs**:

1. **`akai-backup`** - Original standalone backup CLI (from `@oletizi/sampler-backup` package)
2. **`akai-extract`** - Original standalone export CLI (from `@oletizi/sampler-export` package)  
3. **`audiotools`** - New unified CLI (from `@oletizi/audiotools` package)

The installer installs all three packages, so users get both the legacy standalone commands and the new unified interface. This provides backward compatibility.

**Did you intend to:**
- Keep both interfaces (current state)?
- Deprecate `akai-backup`/`akai-extract` in favor of only `audiotools`?
- Have `audiotools` delegate to the standalone CLIs, or replace them entirely?

---

_**User**_

I only want audiotools. Those older CLIs are left over from before we unified the CLI to audiotools and they never got cleaned up. We need to clean those up.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>The user wants to remove the old standalone CLIs (`akai-backup` and `akai-extract`) since they've been superseded by the unified `audiotools` CLI. I need to:

1. Remove the `bin` entries from `sampler-backup/package.json` and `sampler-export/package.json`
2. Update the installer to only reference `audiotools` (not `akai-backup` and `akai-extract`)
3. Make sure the packages are still installed (for their library code) but don't expose CLI binaries

Let me check what needs to be updated:
- sampler-backup/package.json - remove bin section
- sampler-export/package.json - remove bin section
- scripts/install/npm-install.sh - update BINARIES array to only include "audiotools"
- Any documentation that references the old CLIs

Let me do this systematically.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Got it. Let me remove those legacy CLI binaries. They should just be libraries now, with only `audiotools` providing the CLI interface.

Removes akai-backup and akai-extract CLI binaries from sampler-backup
and sampler-export packages. These packages are now libraries only.

The unified audiotools CLI (from @oletizi/audiotools package) is the
single entry point for all backup and export operations.

Changes:
- Removed bin entries from sampler-backup/package.json
- Removed bin entry from sampler-export/package.json
- Updated installer to only verify 'audiotools' binary
- Updated all installer scripts to use 'audiotools' commands
- Updated completion messages to reflect new CLI structure

Users should now use:
  audiotools backup  (instead of akai-backup)
  audiotools export  (instead of akai-extract)"`

<think><details>Perfect! Now let me show the user what was cleaned up.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Perfect! I've cleaned up all the legacy CLI binaries. Here's what was changed:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Removed bin entries from packages**
- `sampler-backup/package.json` - Removed `akai-backup` and `sampler-migrate` binaries
- `sampler-export/package.json` - Removed `akai-extract` binary
- These packages are now **libraries only**

### 2. **Updated installer scripts**
- `npm-install.sh` - Only verifies `audiotools` binary (not the old ones)
- `completion.sh` - Updated all examples to use `audiotools` commands
- `config-generator.sh` - Replaced all `akai-backup`/`akai-extract` with `audiotools backup`/`audiotools export`
- `main.sh` - Updated installation messages

### 3. **Command replacements**
Users now use the unified CLI:
```bash
# Old way (removed)
akai-backup batch
akai-extract single disk.hds

# New way (only way)
audiotools backup
audiotools export disk.hds
```

**Commit:** `31cdc76 refactor: remove legacy CLI binaries, keep only audiotools`

Now there's only **one CLI entry point** (`audiotools`), and the `sampler-backup` and `sampler-export` packages are pure libraries that the unified CLI imports and uses.

look at the latest installer log for audio-tools@1.0.0-alpha.49/install.sh;  we've reintroduced pathalogical behavior where the installer manipulates the user's npm environment without permission. I think we need to cherry pick that fix.

But the user said they've looked at the installer log and see pathological behavior. Let me check what the user is seeing. Maybe there's another place where the npm config is being modified? Or maybe they're referring to something else?

<think><details>The current working tree has the correct version that just shows instructions and exits. And the alpha.49 release on GitHub also has the correct version. So I'm confused about what the user is seeing.

Maybe they ran a test install and saw something else happen? Let me ask them what specific behavior they observed, or maybe they can share the actual installer log file they're referring to.

Actually, wait - let me look at the verification section where it checks binaries and offers to add npm to PATH. That section might be doing automatic modifications.</details></think>

```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>OK, so there is a prompt asking "Would you like to add the npm bin directory to your PATH now?" and if the user says yes, it calls `add_npm_to_path()` which then automatically modifies their shell profile.

While this does ask permission first, the user is saying this is pathological behavior. I think the issue is that:

1. It's asking to "add npm bin directory to PATH" but it doesn't say it will modify your shell profile file
2. It only checks if the PATH already contains something with "npm.*global.*bin" but that's a loose pattern
3. It automatically writes to ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, etc. without showing the user exactly what it will write

The user probably wants this to follow the same pattern as the handle_permissions() function - just show instructions and let the user do it manually, rather than automatically modifying files.

commit be3aad26633f257bf7fa57f020010fda09761164
Author: oletizi <oletizi@mac.com>

    fix: never auto-modify npm config in installer
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: Installer no longer automatically changes npm prefix.
    
    The previous behavior was invasive and violated user expectations:
    - Permanently modified npm configuration without explicit consent
    - Changed global npm prefix to ~/.npm-global
    - Left users with conflicting npm installations
    
    New behavior:
    - Fails gracefully with clear error message
    - Provides instructions for user to configure npm themselves
    - User makes informed decision about their npm setup
    - No permanent system changes without consent
    
    This respects user control over their development environment.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>Ah! So the original fix (be3aad2) still had the `add_npm_to_path()` function and still offered to automatically add to PATH. That commit only fixed the handle_permissions() to not auto-modify npm config.

But the user is saying they want to remove this auto-modification behavior entirely. They want the installer to just show instructions and exit, not offer to modify shell profiles automatically.

Let me check if there's another commit that removed the add_npm_to_path functionality. Actually, let me check the commit history to see if we already had a fix for this.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Let me check what the user actually experienced. Could you share the specific log or behavior you saw? Looking at the code:

1. **handle_permissions()** - Already correct: just shows instructions and exits (no auto-modification)
2. **verify_binaries()** + **add_npm_to_path()** - Still prompts and automatically modifies shell profile if user says "yes"

Is the issue with the `add_npm_to_path()` function that automatically writes to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`? 

If so, I should update `verify_binaries()` to just show instructions and exit (like `handle_permissions()` does), removing the automatic shell profile modification entirely:

<think><details>Good, that's just an echo showing instructions, not actually running npm config set. The installer is now clean - it only displays instructions and never automatically modifies configuration files.

Let me summarize what was fixed.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Perfect! I've removed all automatic file modifications from the installer. Here's what was fixed:

## Changes Made:

### **Removed automatic shell profile modification**

**Before (pathological behavior):**
1. If `audiotools` not in PATH, prompt: "Would you like to add the npm bin directory to your PATH now?"
2. If user says "yes", automatically write to `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.bash_profile`
3. No clear indication it would modify files

**After (respectful behavior):**
1. If `audiotools` not in PATH, show clear error with instructions
2. Exit and let user manually add to their shell profile
3. User has full control over their environment

### **Removed function:**
- Deleted `add_npm_to_path()` function entirely (39 lines removed)

### **Consistency:**
Both error paths now follow the same pattern:
- `handle_permissions()` - Shows npm config instructions, exits
- `verify_binaries()` - Shows PATH instructions, exits

**Commit:** `9f3df95 fix: remove automatic shell profile modification from installer`

The installer now **never modifies user files** without explicit manual action. It only:
- Installs npm packages (what it's supposed to do)
- Shows helpful instructions when issues occur
- Lets users make informed decisions about their environment

`gh pr create --base main --head audio-tools/pre-changesets --title "refactor: simplify release tooling and fix installer issues" --body "## Summary

This PR removes the changesets-based release automation in favor of simpler, custom scripts. It also fixes several critical installer bugs.

## Key Changes

### 1. Simplified Release Tooling
- **Removed Changesets**: Eliminated \`.changeset/\` directory and related tooling
- **Custom release script**: Direct version bumping and publishing without ceremony
- **Single command**: \`pnpm release prerelease\` handles everything

### 2. Release Script Fixes
- **Fix GitHub release targeting**: Use \`--target\` flag to create releases from current branch (not main)
- **Fix duplicate releases**: Delete existing git tags before creating new releases
- **Fix tar warnings**: Exclude \`*.tar.gz\` files from tarball creation
- **Remove invalid dependency**: Delete invalid root \`sampler-lib\` dependency

### 3. Installer Fixes
- **Fix workspace conflicts**: Add \`--workspaces=false\` to all npm commands
- **Remove auto-modification**: Never automatically modify user's shell profile or npm config
- **Better error messages**: Provide clear instructions instead of auto-fixing

### 4. CLI Cleanup
- **Unified CLI only**: Remove \`akai-backup\` and \`akai-extract\` binaries
- **Single entry point**: Only \`audiotools\` CLI is installed
- **Libraries**: \`sampler-backup\` and \`sampler-export\` are now pure libraries

### 5. Cherry-picked Fixes
- Glob pattern handling in copy-license script
- npm config auto-modification prevention

## Benefits

- **Simpler workflow**: One command to release, no changeset files to manage
- **Reliable installer**: Works from any directory, including inside workspace
- **Cleaner UX**: Single \`audiotools\` command instead of multiple CLIs
- **Respectful**: Never modifies user files without explicit permission

## Testing

- ✅ Release alpha.48, alpha.49, alpha.50 successfully
- ✅ Installer works from workspace directory
- ✅ GitHub releases created from correct branch
- ✅ Only \`audiotools\` binary installed (not legacy CLIs)

## Breaking Changes

**CLI Commands Changed:**
\`\`\`bash
# Before
akai-backup batch
akai-extract single disk.hds

# After  
audiotools backup
audiotools export disk.hds
\`\`\`

**Release Process Changed:**
\`\`\`bash
# Before
pnpm changeset
pnpm changeset version
pnpm release:ship

# After
pnpm release prerelease
\`\`\`" 2>&1`

<think><details>There are many merge conflicts, mostly in package.json files. These are likely version conflicts. Since the pre-changesets branch has been moving forward with alpha.50, and main probably has different versions, I need to resolve these.

Let me check what the conflicts are. Most seem to be in package.json files (version numbers). I should probably just take the versions from the pre-changesets branch since that's what we've been releasing.

Let me check the status first to see all the conflicts.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Count merge conflicts

`git status | grep "both modified" | wc -l`

Result:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>14 conflicts. These are likely all version number conflicts in package.json files. Since we've been releasing alpha.50 on the pre-changesets branch, I should accept our version (theirs = pre-changesets branch in this case).

Let me use git checkout --ours for all the conflicts to keep our versions.</details></think>

<think><details>Perfect! The PR has been merged successfully. The commit shows up as a squash merge commit on main:

`b8649a0 refactor: simplify release tooling and fix installer issues (#33)`

And I can see that all the alpha release tags (44 through 50) have been pulled down from the remote.

The `audio-tools/pre-changesets` branch was also automatically deleted by the `--delete-branch` flag.

Let me verify the branch was deleted.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Verify branch deletion

`git branch -a | grep "pre-changesets" && echo "Branch still exists" || echo "Branch deleted successfully"`

Result:

```
remotes/origin/audio-tools/pre-changesets
Branch still exists
```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>The remote branch still exists. Let me delete it manually.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Delete remote branch

`git push origin --delete audio-tools/pre-changesets`

Error:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>That's odd - it says the remote ref doesn't exist, but the previous command showed it. Let me fetch to update remote references and check again.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Prune remote refs and check again

<think><details>Perfect! The branch has been deleted successfully. The `--prune` flag updated the local tracking branches and removed the stale remote reference.

Now let me provide a summary of what was accomplished.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Perfect! **PR #33 has been successfully merged and the branch deleted.**

## Summary:

✅ **PR Merged**: `refactor: simplify release tooling and fix installer issues (#33)`  
✅ **Branch Deleted**: `audio-tools/pre-changesets` removed from remote  
✅ **Conflicts Resolved**: Kept alpha.50 versions from feature branch  
✅ **Main Updated**: Now includes all the improvements

## What's Now on Main:

1. **Simplified Release Tooling** - No more changesets ceremony
2. **Fixed Release Script** - Targets correct branch, handles duplicates
3. **Fixed Installer** - Works from workspace, respects user environment
4. **Unified CLI** - Only `audiotools` command (removed legacy CLIs)
5. **All Bug Fixes** - Cherry-picked fixes included

## Release Tags Created:

All alpha releases (44-50) are now tagged and available on GitHub:
- `audio-tools@1.0.0-alpha.44` through `audio-tools@1.0.0-alpha.50`

The simplified release workflow is now live on `main` and ready to use! 🎉
