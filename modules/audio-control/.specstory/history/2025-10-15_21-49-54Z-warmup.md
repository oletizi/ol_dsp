I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore the audio-control codebase.

I have context about:
- **Working directory**: `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-control`
- **Current branch**: `fix/issue-36-correct-device-id`
- **Recent activity**: Integration test infrastructure and device ID corrections for Launch Control XL3
- **Project**: Audio control monorepo with TypeScript utilities for MIDI mapping and audio device control

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns
- Search code and text with regex
- Read specific file contents
- Navigate the codebase structure
- Verify file operations

What would you like me to find or explore in the audio-control codebase?
