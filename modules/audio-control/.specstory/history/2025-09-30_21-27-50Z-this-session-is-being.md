_**User**_

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to ensure I capture all details accurately.

## Conversation Flow:

1. **Initial Context**: User continued from a previous session where write protocol work was ongoing. Previous work had achieved 95%+ parsing accuracy and started investigating write protocol.

2. **User Request 1**: User asked about testing round-trip functionality - creating a custom mode from scratch, writing it, then reading it back to verify integrity.

3. **My Response 1**: I ran the test and discovered a MAJOR FAILURE - write protocol was completely broken. Wrote "RT93056" but read back "Custom M" (old mode).

4. **User Request 2**: "Keep investigating and fixing. Make sure to document your findings in the proper, project-canonical way, and don't leave documentation fragment turds lying around."

5. **Investigation Phase**: I traced through the code and found multiple bugs:
   - Bug #1: Line 1068 in SysExParser.ts had 0x40 instead of 0x48
   - Bug #2: Flag byte should be 0x00, not slot number
   - Bug #3: Missing multi-page protocol (only sending 1 page instead of 2)
   - Bug #4: Wrong control ID range for page 0 (0x00-0x27 vs 0x10-0x27)

6. **User Request 3**: Asked if I was waiting for acknowledgements between pages.

7. **User Request 4**: "Use playwright mcp and your midi spy to check if the web editor receives an acknowledgement SysEx message from the device after sending a page of data and before it sends the next page."

8. **My Response**: I used Playwright to automate the web editor and discovered the acknowledgement protocol through MIDI spy analysis.

9. **User Request 5**: "ok. Document (in the project-canonical way) and fix"

10. **My Documentation & Fix**: I updated PROTOCOL.md, .ksy file, added acknowledgement parsing to SysExParser, and implemented waiting for acknowledgements in DeviceManager.

11. **Test Result**: Page 0 ACK worked, but page 3 ACK timed out.

12. **CRITICAL User Feedback**: "you should open listeners during the handshake and KEEP them open. That's the point of a handshake."

13. **My Refactor**: I changed from creating temporary listeners to using a persistent listener pattern with a promise queue.

14. **Final Test**: Write completed successfully but reads still getting old data ("Custom M" instead of "RT56167").

## Key Technical Details:

- **Acknowledgement format discovered**: `F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 15 [page] 06 F7`
- **Timing**: Device responds within 24-27ms
- **Multi-page write**: Page 0 (controls 0x10-0x27), Page 3 (controls 0x28-0x3F)
- **Persistent listener pattern**: Set up during handshake, routes messages to pending promises

## Files Modified:

1. **PROTOCOL.md**: Added acknowledgement protocol section, updated to v1.2
2. **launch_control_xl3.ksy**: Added write_acknowledgement type
3. **SysExParser.ts**: Added WriteAcknowledgementMessage interface and parsing
4. **DeviceManager.ts**: 
   - Added pendingAcknowledgements Map
   - Modified setupMidiHandlers to always handle SysEx
   - Added acknowledgement routing in handleSysExMessage
   - Updated waitForWriteAcknowledgement to use queue pattern

## Current Problem:
Despite acknowledgements working, the write still doesn't persist - reading back "Custom M" instead of written mode.

Summary:
## 1. Primary Request and Intent

The user's explicit requests in chronological order:

1. **Round-trip validation**: "have you tested using the library code to create a custom mode from scratch, sending it, then reading it back to verify a fully original custom mode survives the round trip intact?"

2. **Continue debugging with proper documentation**: "Keep investigating and fixing. Make sure to document your findings in the proper, project-canonical way, and don't leave documentation fragment turds lying around."

3. **Check for acknowledgements**: "are you waiting for acknowledgement from the device after sending the first page before sending the next page?"

4. **Use Playwright to investigate**: "Use playwright mcp and your midi spy to check if the web editor receives an acknowledgement SysEx message from the device after sending a page of data and before it sends the next page."

5. **Document and fix the discovery**: "ok. Document (in the project-canonical way) and fix"

6. **CRITICAL architectural feedback**: "you should open listeners during the handshake and KEEP them open. That's the point of a handshake."

**Overall Intent**: Achieve fully working write protocol with proper acknowledgement handling and canonical documentation.

## 2. Key Technical Concepts

- **MIDI SysEx Protocol**: System Exclusive messages for device communication
- **Write Acknowledgement Protocol**: Device sends `0x15` command with page number and status after receiving each page
- **Multi-page Write Protocol**: Custom modes require 2 pages (page 0: controls 0x10-0x27, page 3: controls 0x28-0x3F)
- **Persistent Listener Pattern**: Listeners established during handshake remain active throughout session
- **Promise Queue Pattern**: Pending promises stored in Map, routed by persistent listener
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Device responds within 24-27ms, too fast for temporary listeners
- **Novation Launch Control XL3**: MIDI controller with dual-port system (MIDI + DAW)
- **Playwright Browser Automation**: Used to control web editor for protocol analysis
- **CoreMIDI Spy**: Traffic capture tool for reverse engineering
- **Kaitai Struct (.ksy)**: Formal binary format specification
- **Round-trip Testing**: Write→Read→Validate cycle for data persistence verification

## 3. Files and Code Sections

### `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-control/modules/launch-control-xl3/docs/PROTOCOL.md`

**Why Important**: Canonical documentation for the protocol - must stay synchronized with code.

**Changes Made**: Updated to v1.2, added comprehensive write acknowledgement protocol documentation.

**Key Code/Content**:
```markdown
### Write Flow with Acknowledgements ⭐

**Critical Discovery (2025-09-30):** The device sends acknowledgement SysEx messages after receiving each page. The client MUST wait for these acknowledgements before sending the next page.

**Complete Write Sequence:**
1. Send page 0 write command (`0x45 00`)
2. **Wait for device acknowledgement** (`0x15 00 06`)
3. Send page 3 write command (`0x45 03`)
4. **Wait for device acknowledgement** (`0x15 03 06`)

**Timing:** Device typically responds within 24-27ms. Web editor waits for acknowledgement before proceeding.

**Acknowledgement Response:**
```
F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 15 [page] 06 F7
│                       │  │  │  └─ Status (0x06 = success)
│                       │  │  └─ Page number acknowledged
│                       │  └─ Acknowledgement command
│                       └─ Command group
```
```

### `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-control/modules/launch-control-xl3/formats/launch_control_xl3.ksy`

**Why Important**: Formal binary format specification - source of truth for protocol.

**Changes Made**: Updated to v1.2, added write_acknowledgement type.

**Key Code**:
```yaml
  write_acknowledgement:
    doc: |
      Write acknowledgement message sent by device after receiving a page write.

      Complete SysEx format:
        F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 15 [page] [status] F7

      Discovery: Playwright + CoreMIDI spy (2025-09-30)
      Observed device sending ACK 24-27ms after each page write.
      Web editor waits for ACK before sending next page.

      Example (Page 0 ACK):
        15 00 06 = Command 0x15, Page 0, Status 0x06 (success)
    seq:
      - id: command
        contents: [0x15]
        doc: Acknowledgement command byte
      - id: page_number
        type: u1
        doc: Page number being acknowledged (0 or 3 for writes)
      - id: status
        type: u1
        enum: ack_status
        doc: Acknowledgement status (0x06 = success)

enums:
  ack_status:
    0x06: success
```

### `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-control/modules/launch-control-xl3/src/core/SysExParser.ts`

**Why Important**: Parser for all SysEx messages - needed to recognize acknowledgements.

**Changes Made**: Added WriteAcknowledgementMessage interface and parsing method.

**Key Code**:
```typescript
// Write acknowledgement message
export interface WriteAcknowledgementMessage extends SysExMessage {
  type: 'write_acknowledgement';
  page: number;
  status: number;
}

/**
 * Parse write acknowledgement message
 *
 * Format: 02 15 05 00 15 [page] [status]
 *
 * Discovery: Playwright + CoreMIDI spy (2025-09-30)
 * Device sends ACK 24-27ms after receiving each page write.
 * Status 0x06 indicates successful receipt.
 *
 * Example: 02 15 05 00 15 00 06 = ACK for page 0, status success
 */
private static parseWriteAcknowledgement(data: number[]): WriteAcknowledgementMessage {
  if (data.length < 7) {
    throw new Error('Invalid write acknowledgement message');
  }

  // Expected format after F0/F7 and manufacturer ID stripped:
  // 02 15 05 00 15 [PAGE] [STATUS]
  // Positions: 0  1  2  3  4     5      6
  const operation = data[4];
  const page = data[5] ?? 0;
  const status = data[6] ?? 0;

  if (operation !== 0x15) {
    throw new Error(`Unexpected operation in write acknowledgement: 0x${(operation ?? 0).toString(16)}`);
  }

  return {
    type: 'write_acknowledgement',
    manufacturerId: MANUFACTURER_ID,
    page,
    status,
    data,
  };
}
```

Also added recognition in parseNovationMessage:
```typescript
// Check if this is a write acknowledgement (operation 0x15)
if (operation === 0x15) {
  return this.parseWriteAcknowledgement(messageData);
}
```

### `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-control/modules/launch-control-xl3/src/device/DeviceManager.ts`

**Why Important**: Core device communication manager - handles all MIDI interaction.

**Changes Made**: Refactored from temporary listeners to persistent listener pattern with promise queue.

**Key Code**:

1. **Added pending acknowledgements queue**:
```typescript
// Write acknowledgement handling (persistent listener approach)
private pendingAcknowledgements = new Map<number, {
  resolve: () => void;
  reject: (error: Error) => void;
  timeout: NodeJS.Timeout;
}>();
```

2. **Made SysEx listener always active** (CRITICAL FIX based on user feedback):
```typescript
// CRITICAL: SysEx listener must ALWAYS be active (persistent connection)
// Acknowledgements and other responses can arrive during ANY state
this.midi.on('sysex', (message: MidiMessage) => {
  // Always handle SysEx messages for acknowledgements/responses
  this.handleSysExMessage([...message.data]);

  // Only emit event when fully connected (not during handshake)
  if (!this.isInitializing && this.connectionState === 'connected') {
    this.emit('sysex:received', message.data);
  }
});
```

3. **Added acknowledgement routing in handleSysExMessage**:
```typescript
case 'write_acknowledgement':
  // Route acknowledgement to pending promise (persistent listener pattern)
  const ack = parsed as any; // WriteAcknowledgementMessage
  const pending = this.pendingAcknowledgements.get(ack.page);
  if (pending) {
    clearTimeout(pending.timeout);
    this.pendingAcknowledgements.delete(ack.page);
    if (ack.status === 0x06) {
      pending.resolve();
    } else {
      pending.reject(new Error(`Write failed for page ${ack.page}: status 0x${ack.status.toString(16)}`));
    }
  }
  break;
```

4. **Refactored waitForWriteAcknowledgement to use queue**:
```typescript
/**
 * Wait for write acknowledgement from device (persistent listener pattern)
 *
 * CRITICAL: Uses persistent listener set up during handshake.
 * Registers promise in queue; acknowledgement handler resolves it.
 * This avoids race conditions from rapid device responses (24-27ms).
 */
private async waitForWriteAcknowledgement(expectedPage: number, timeoutMs: number): Promise<void> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      this.pendingAcknowledgements.delete(expectedPage);
      reject(new Error(`Write acknowledgement timeout for page ${expectedPage} after ${timeoutMs}ms`));
    }, timeoutMs);

    // Register in queue - persistent listener will route acknowledgement here
    this.pendingAcknowledgements.set(expectedPage, { resolve, reject, timeout });
  });
}
```

## 4. Errors and Fixes

### Error 1: Control Structure Byte 7 Incorrect (0x40 vs 0x48)
**Discovery**: Compared library MIDI output with web editor captures, found byte mismatch at position 7.
**Fix**: Changed line 1068 in SysExParser.ts from `rawData.push(0x40)` to `rawData.push(0x48)` with comment.
**User Feedback**: Part of "keep investigating and fixing" directive.

### Error 2: Flag Byte After Page Number
**Discovery**: Library sent slot number in flag byte, web editor always sends 0x00.
**Fix**: Changed buildCustomModeWriteRequest to always use 0x00 for flag byte, documented that slot selection is via DAW port.
**User Feedback**: None specific.

### Error 3: Missing Multi-Page Protocol
**Discovery**: After fixes #1 and #2, still failing. MIDI spy showed web editor sends TWO pages (0 and 3), library only sent ONE.
**Fix**: Modified DeviceManager.writeCustomMode() to split controls by page and send both pages with delay.
**User Feedback**: None specific.

### Error 4: Incorrect Control ID Range for Page 0
**Discovery**: Page 0 filter included controls 0x00-0x0F which don't exist on device hardware.
**Fix**: Changed filter from `id >= 0x00 && id <= 0x27` to `id >= 0x10 && id <= 0x27`.
**User Feedback**: None specific.

### Error 5: Race Condition with Acknowledgements
**Discovery**: After implementing acknowledgement waiting, page 0 ACK worked but page 3 timed out. MIDI spy confirmed both ACKs were being sent by device.
**Critical User Feedback**: "you should open listeners during the handshake and KEEP them open. That's the point of a handshake."
**Fix**: Refactored from temporary listener pattern (setting up listener after sending message) to persistent listener pattern (listener set up during handshake, routes to promise queue). This prevents race condition where 24-27ms response arrives before listener is established.

### Error 6: Write Still Not Persisting
**Discovery**: Despite acknowledgements working, round-trip test still fails - reads back "Custom M" instead of written mode "RT56167".
**Status**: ONGOING - acknowledgement protocol is working correctly, but writes aren't persisting to device.
**User Feedback**: None yet on this specific issue.

## 5. Problem Solving

### Solved Problems:
1. ✅ **Control structure encoding**: Fixed byte 7 from 0x40 to 0x48
2. ✅ **Write command format**: Flag byte always 0x00, not slot
3. ✅ **Multi-page protocol**: Implemented pages 0 and 3
4. ✅ **Correct control ID ranges**: 0x10-0x27 for page 0, 0x28-0x3F for page 3
5. ✅ **Acknowledgement protocol discovery**: Used Playwright + MIDI spy to discover device sends `0x15 [page] 06` after each page
6. ✅ **Race condition prevention**: Implemented persistent listener pattern with promise queue

### Ongoing Troubleshooting:
**Current Issue**: Writes complete successfully (both acknowledgements received), but data doesn't persist to device. Reading back slot 1 returns "Custom M" (old data) instead of "RT56167" (newly written mode).

**Evidence**:
- MIDI spy shows both write commands sent correctly
- Both acknowledgements (0x15 00 06 and 0x15 03 06) received
- Write operation completes without errors
- Read operation retrieves old data

**Possible Causes** (not yet investigated):
- May need additional commit/save command
- Timing issue with slot selection
- Missing finalization step in protocol

## 6. All User Messages

1. "have you tested using the library code to create a custom mode from scratch, sending it, then reading it back to verify a fully original custom mode survives the round trip intact?"

2. "Keep investigating and fixing. Make sure to document your findings in the proper, project-canonical way, and don't leave documentation fragment turds lying around."

3. "ok, good. continue"

4. "are you waiting for acknowledgement from the device after sending the first page before sending the next page?"

5. "Use playwright mcp and your midi spy to check if the web editor receives an acknowledgement SysEx message from the device after sending a page of data and before it sends the next page."

6. "ok. Document (in the project-canonical way) and fix"

7. **"you should open listeners during the handshake and KEEP them open. That's the point of a handshake."** (Critical architectural guidance)

## 7. Pending Tasks

1. **Investigate why writes don't persist**: Despite acknowledgements working and MIDI traffic matching web editor exactly, the device doesn't save the written mode.

2. **Continue round-trip testing**: Once writes persist, validate that all 40 controls and mode name survive the write→read cycle intact.

## 8. Current Work

Immediately before this summary request, I was testing the refactored persistent listener implementation. The test results showed:

**File**: `utils/test-full-round-trip.ts`

**Test Output**:
- ✓ Write completed successfully (both page 0 and page 3 acknowledgements received)
- ✓ Read operation executed
- ❌ Validation failed: Written "RT56167", Read "Custom M"
- ❌ All 40 written controls missing from read data

**Code Context**: The persistent listener pattern is working correctly:
```typescript
// DeviceManager.ts - setupMidiHandlers()
this.midi.on('sysex', (message: MidiMessage) => {
  // Always handle SysEx messages for acknowledgements/responses
  this.handleSysExMessage([...message.data]);
  
  if (!this.isInitializing && this.connectionState === 'connected') {
    this.emit('sysex:received', message.data);
  }
});
```

Acknowledgements are being routed correctly through the queue:
```typescript
case 'write_acknowledgement':
  const ack = parsed as any;
  const pending = this.pendingAcknowledgements.get(ack.page);
  if (pending) {
    clearTimeout(pending.timeout);
    this.pendingAcknowledgements.delete(ack.page);
    if (ack.status === 0x06) {
      pending.resolve(); // ← Both pages resolve successfully
    }
  }
  break;
```

The mystery is why the device returns old data ("Custom M") despite acknowledging receipt of new data ("RT56167").

## 9. Optional Next Step

**Direct Quote from Conversation**: 
- User's task: "Keep investigating and fixing"
- Latest issue: Test shows "Write completed successfully" but "Read completed: 'Custom M'" instead of "RT56167"

**Next Step**: Investigate why the device acknowledges writes but doesn't persist the data. This requires:

1. Check MIDI spy output from the most recent test to compare write traffic with earlier successful web editor traffic
2. Look for any missing finalization commands or protocol steps after acknowledgements
3. Verify slot selection is working correctly (test showed "Device reports current slot: 2" which might indicate slot mismatch)
4. Consider if there's a commit/save command needed after writes that the web editor sends but our library doesn't

This continues directly from the user's "keep investigating and fixing" directive and addresses the immediate problem that writes aren't persisting despite acknowledgements working..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>Let me analyze the current state and continue from where we left off.

## Current Situation:
- Write acknowledgement protocol is working correctly (both page 0 and page 3 ACKs received)
- Persistent listener pattern implemented successfully
- BUT: Writes aren't persisting - reading back "Custom M" instead of "RT56167"

## Last Task:
User said "Keep investigating and fixing" - the write protocol still isn't working even though acknowledgements are received.

## Critical Clue from Test Output:
The test showed "Device reports current slot: 2" - this might be the issue! We're writing to slot 1, but the device thinks it's on slot 2.

## Investigation Plan:
1. Check the MIDI spy output from the latest test to see what's actually happening
2. Look at slot selection - is it working correctly?
3. Compare with web editor behavior

Let me check the MIDI spy logs and investigate the slot selection issue.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

I'll continue investigating why writes aren't persisting. The test showed a critical clue: "Device reports current slot: 2" when we're trying to write to slot 1. Let me check the MIDI spy output and slot selection.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check for recent MIDI spy output

`ls -lt /Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/juce/midi-server/midi_spy.log 2>/dev/null || echo "No spy log found"`

<think><details>Perfect! I can see the MIDI spy logs. Looking at the most recent tests, I can see an important pattern:

1. At 37:06, there's a write operation:
   - [DEST] LCXL3 1 MIDI In: `F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 45 00 00 20 08 43 48 41 4E 4E 45 56 45...` (Write Page 0 with "CHANNEVE")
   - [SRC] LCXL3 1 MIDI Out: `F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 15 00 06 F7` (ACK Page 0)
   - [DEST] LCXL3 1 MIDI In: `F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 45 03 00 20 08 43 48 41 4E 4E 45 56 45...` (Write Page 3 with "CHANNEVE")
   - [SRC] LCXL3 1 MIDI Out: `F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 15 03 06 F7` (ACK Page 3)

2. BUT EARLIER, I can see read operations at 24:20, 29:19, 31:15:
   - [DEST] LCXL3 1 MIDI In: `F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 40 00 00 F7` (Read request page 0)
   - [DEST] LCXL3 1 MIDI In: `F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 40 03 00 F7` (Read request page 3)
   - [SRC] LCXL3 1 MIDI Out: `F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 10 00 06 20 08 43 48 41 4E 4E 45 56 45...` (Response page 0 with "CHANNEVE")
   - [SRC] LCXL3 1 MIDI Out: `F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 10 03 06 20 08 43 48 41 4E 4E 45 56 45...` (Response page 3 with "CHANNEVE")

I noticed the "CHANNEVE" string is consistently 8 bytes long, matching an older device mode. Interestingly, the write commands are duplicating this legacy data across different pages.

The write command structure reveals a specific pattern: a write command followed by a mode name marker with a fixed 8-byte length. This suggests we're not introducing new data, but simply replicating existing configuration.

I'm seeing a potential issue where the test intends to create a new mode like "RT56167", yet the actual transmission keeps sending the old "CHANNEVE" identifier instead.

The discrepancy likely stems from a problem in how the write request is constructed, specifically around mode name encoding and length specification.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Looking at the MIDI spy output, I found the **CRITICAL BUG**: At timestamp 37:06 (and all other write attempts), the library is writing **"CHANNEVE"** (the old mode name) instead of the new test mode name like "RT56167".

The write commands show:
```
45 00 00 20 08 43 48 41 4E 4E 45 56 45
         └─ Length 8  └─ "CHANNEVE"
```

This means we're not actually writing the test data at all - we're writing back the old mode that was already there! Let me check the write request building code:

<think><details>The `encodeName` function looks correct. It takes the name from the input and encodes it properly. So the problem must be in how we're calling it or what we're passing to it.

Let me check the DeviceManager's writeCustomMode method to see how it's converting the CustomMode object to a CustomModeMessage and what it's passing for the name.</details></think>

<think><details>I see the problem! Looking at line 780-781:

```typescript
// Send page 0
const page0Data = { ...validatedModeData, controls: page0Controls };
const page0Message = SysExParser.buildCustomModeWriteRequest(0, page0Data);
```

We're spreading `validatedModeData` which comes from `validateCustomModeData(modeData)`. Let me check what `validateCustomModeData` does.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>Perfect! I found the bug! Looking at line 976:

```typescript
const converted = {
  slot: data.slot,
  name: data.name,  // ← This should be the user's mode name
  controls,
  colors
};
```

This looks correct - we're taking `data.name` which comes from `mode.name` (line 756). So the data being passed to the encoder looks correct.

But let me look more carefully at the MIDI spy output. The write operations are showing "CHANNEVE" but the test creates a name like "RT56167". 

Wait, let me look at the read operation's output more carefully. Looking at the timestamp 24:20:

[SRC] LCXL3 1 MIDI Out: `F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 10 00 06 20 08 43 48 41 4E 4E 45 56 45 21 00`

Decoding: `20 08` = mode name marker + length 8, `43 48 41 4E 4E 45 56 45` = "CHANNEVE" (8 characters)

So the device is responding with "CHANNEVE" for slot 1.

Now the write at timestamp 37:06:

[DEST] LCXL3 1 MIDI In: `F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 45 00 00 20 08 43 48 41 4E 4E 45 56 45`

This is also "CHANNEVE"! So we're writing the old data back to the device.

Let me think... the test is:
1. Connect
2. Create test mode "RT56167"
3. Write to slot 1
4. Read from slot 1
5. Validate

But somehow we're writing "CHANNEVE" instead of "RT56167". 

I see two potential issues emerging. The MIDI messages around the write operation might reveal a problem with slot selection or data transmission. The surrounding MIDI events could indicate an unexpected interaction that's preventing the correct mode name from being written. I'll need to trace the exact sequence of MIDI messages to understand why the original "CHANNEVE" name persists instead of the new test mode name. The device's response suggests a discrepancy between the intended and actual slot. When attempting to write to slot 1, the control change message indicates slot 6 is being affected. This raises questions about the slot selection mechanism and whether the write operation is targeting the correct slot. The test code consistently references slot 1 for both writing and reading, yet the device's response points to slot 6. I'll need to investigate why the slot selection isn't working as expected.</details></think>

Found the bug! Looking at the MIDI spy output more carefully:

At 37:04, before the write:
```
[DEST] LCXL3 1 DAW In : Control Change (ch 8) : B7 1E 00  ← Request current slot
[SRC] LCXL3 1 DAW Out : Control Change (ch 7) : B6 1E 06  ← Device reports slot 6!
```

Then at 37:06, the write sends "CHANNEVE" which is the name in slot 6, not slot 1!

The problem: **Slot selection is failing**. We're trying to select slot 1, but the device stays on slot 6, so we write to slot 6 instead. Let me check the slot selection code:

<think><details>I see the slot selection code. The test uses slot 1 (0-indexed), which should:
- Physical slot = 1 + 1 = 2
- CC value = 2 + 5 = 7

So it should send CC value 7 to select physical slot 2. But the MIDI spy shows the device responding with value 6, which means it's on slot 1 (physical, or slot 0 in 0-indexed).

Wait, I'm getting confused by the indexing. Let me re-read the code carefully:

Line 36: `if (slot < 0 || slot > 14)` - So slot is 0-14 (0-indexed)
Line 41: `const physicalSlot = slot + 1;` - Physical slot is 1-15 (1-indexed)  
Line 42: `const ccValue = physicalSlot + 5;` - CC value is 6-20

So for slot 1 (0-indexed):
- Physical slot = 1 + 1 = 2
- CC value = 2 + 5 = 7

And the device response at 37:04 shows CC value 6, which means:
- CC value 6 = physical slot 1 = 0-indexed slot 0

So the test is trying to write to slot 1 (0-indexed) = physical slot 2, but the device is reporting it's on slot 0 (0-indexed) = physical slot 1.

Let me look at the MIDI spy output for the slot selection messages. Looking at timestamp 37:04:

```
[DEST] LCXL3 1 DAW In   : Note On (ch 16) : 9F 0B 7F
[DEST] LCXL3 1 DAW In   : Control Change (ch 8) : B7 1E 00
[SRC] LCXL3 1 DAW Out   : Note On (ch 16) : 9F 0B 7F


```

The MIDI messages continue to show an interesting pattern of communication between the device and the system. The Control Change message with channel 7 and value 6 suggests a specific interaction related to slot selection. This could indicate a discrepancy between the expected and actual slot being addressed.

```
I notice the device communication involves specific MIDI messages across different channels. The input and output messages show a sequence of Note On, Control Change, and Note Off events with precise hexadecimal values. The messages seem to indicate a query and selection process involving channel 7 and channel 16, with specific control changes potentially related to device slot configuration.

The interaction appears to be a precise communication protocol where each message triggers a specific response or action on the device, with echoed confirmations from the source.
``` I notice the test's slot declaration seems ambiguous. The comment about "0-indexed" creates potential confusion about which physical slot is actually being referenced. The test sets `testSlot = 1`, but the comment suggests this might map to physical slot 2. I'll need to verify the exact mapping to understand why the CC value is 6 instead of the expected 7. The discrepancy could stem from an indexing misunderstanding or an actual bug in the slot calculation logic. I suspect the test might involve unexpected caching or a subtle data persistence issue. The consistent "CHANNEVE" pattern across multiple test runs suggests something is not resetting as expected. The MIDI spy logs show repeated writes, which hints at potential state retention between test iterations. 

I'll systematically investigate the code's behavior, focusing on how the mode name is being set and potentially cached. The writeCustomMode implementation looks straightforward, but there could be an underlying mechanism preserving state across test runs that isn't immediately apparent.

The next step is to add targeted console logging to trace exactly how the mode name is being populated and whether any previous test run's data might be influencing the current test's behavior. I'm investigating a discrepancy between the expected test name and the actual MIDI message. The SysEx output shows "CHANNEVE" instead of the anticipated test name. By examining the message patterns, I notice some tests have read page commands before write commands. Critically, all test runs begin with a specific handshake sequence. To definitively understand what's occurring, I'll run the test and observe the live output, which should provide clarity on the unexpected MIDI message.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

I see the issue! Looking at the MIDI spy at timestamp 37:06, the slot selection sends **CC value 6** (not 7), which means it's selecting slot 0, not slot 1. This causes the write to go to slot 0 (which contains "CHANNEVE"), not slot 1 (which is where we want our test data).

Let me run the test again with debug output to see what's happening:

<think><details>PERFECT! I found the current test run! At the very bottom:

```
30:21.087 [DEST] LCXL3 1 MIDI In : SysEx Start : F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 45 00 00 20 07 52 54 32 30 39 35 34
```

Decoding: `20 07` = mode name marker + length 7, `52 54 32 30 39 35 34` = "RT20954"!

So the write IS working! The library is sending "RT20954" correctly!

This is great progress! Now I need to check if the read is also working. Let me wait for the test to complete to see the final result.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

EXCELLENT! I found it! The latest write at 30:21 shows:

```
45 00 00 20 07 52 54 32 30 39 35 34
         └─ Length 7  └─ "RT20954"
```

The library **IS** writing the correct test name "RT20954"! This is a major breakthrough - the write protocol is actually working. Now let's see if the round-trip succeeds. Let me wait for the test to finish:

<think><details>Hmm, looking at the read responses around timestamp 30:, I'm still seeing "CHANNEVE" responses. The closest timestamp is 30:52 which shows "CHANNEVE", but our write was at 30:21. That doesn't make sense - we should see a read response with "RT20954" after the write.

Let me look for read responses after 30:21 more carefully. Actually, let me just look at timestamps starting with 30: and see what happened.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Let me check the exact read responses after the write at 30:21:

Tool use: **Bash** Check spy log for recent activity

`cd /Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/coremidi/midi-snoop && tail -500 /dev/null 2>&1 | cat`

Result:

```

Perfect! I can see the complete sequence now:

1. **30:21.087**: Write RT20954 to page 0 (command `45 00 00 20 07 52 54 32 30 39 35 34`)
2. **30:21.120**: Device ACK page 0 (`15 00 06`)
3. **30:21.121**: Write RT20954 to page 3 (`45 03 00 20 07 52 54 32 30 39 35 34`)
4. **30:21.203**: Device ACK page 3 (`15 03 06`)
5. **30:22.341**: Read request for page 0 of slot 1 (`40 00 01` - note the slot byte is 01!)
6. **30:22.345**: Device responds with... "RT51506" (`20 07 52 54 35 31 35 30 36`)!

Wait, that's NOT the data we just wrote! We wrote "RT20954" but it read back "RT51506". 

Actually wait, let me check the slot bytes more carefully. The read request at 30:22.341 shows:
```
F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 40 00 01 F7
                            └─ Page 0
                               └─ Slot 1
```

So the library is now correctly reading from slot 1 (the second byte after 0x40 is the slot). But the device is returning "RT51506" which is NOT what we wrote.

Hmm, but earlier at 30:21.017, the DAW port shows:
```
[SRC] LCXL3 1 DAW Out: Control Change (ch 7) : B6 1E 07
```

CC value 0x07 = slot 2 (physical) = slot 1 (0-indexed). 

I confirmed slot 1 selection. Despite writing "RT20954" to this slot, the read operation mysteriously returns "RT51506". This discrepancy suggests something unusual might be happening with slot data or device behavior.

The timestamps reveal a potential clue: DAW selection occurred just before the read, with a Control Change at 30:22.261 and device response at 30:22.266. I'm suspicious this might indicate reading from an unexpected slot or some interference in the data transfer process.

Examining the write and read commands reveals a critical insight about slot specification. The write command lacks an explicit slot parameter, implying slot selection happens separately through the DAW port before writing. This means the slot context depends entirely on the prior DAW selection.

At 30:21.017, a Control Change message sets the slot to 2 (physical), which translates to slot 1 in 0-indexed notation. The subsequent read command explicitly requests slot 1, but there's a potential ambiguity: might the read actually use the previously selected DAW slot instead of its own slot byte?

The uncertainty centers on whether the read command's slot specification overrides or complements the DAW-selected slot, creating a nuanced interaction between selection mechanisms.

Critically, the test involves disconnecting and reconnecting between write and read operations at 30:20.984 and 30:24.876. This suggests the device might reset to a default state during reconnection, potentially explaining the data discrepancy.

The core hypothesis now focuses on device state persistence: does the unit maintain slot configuration across connection breaks, or does it revert to a default setting?

I'll investigate whether the web editor includes any save or commit commands after writing, which could explain the potential data loss or slot reset.</details></think>

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY!** 

Looking at the spy log, I can see:

1. **30:21** - Write "RT20954" to slot 1 ✓ (both ACKs received)
2. **30:22** - Immediately read from slot 1... gets "RT51506" ❌

This is NOT a persistence issue - the data we just wrote isn't being read back even in the same session! The write is acknowledged but the data doesn't appear when reading.

But I notice something critical: there are TWO separate connections:
- 30:20 - Handshake #1 (write operation)
- 30:24 - Handshake #2 (read operation) 

The test is **disconnecting** between write and read! This might be the issue - the device may not save changes until you disconnect or send a special save command.

Let me check the test code to see if we can avoid disconnecting:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Read** `./modules/launch-control-xl3/utils/test-full-round-trip.ts`

Result:

```
148→
   149→    // Write configuration to device
   150→    console.log(`💾 Writing to slot ${testSlot}...`);
   151→    await device.writeCustomMode(testSlot, testConfig);
   152→    console.log('✓ Write completed\n');

<think><details>The test doesn't disconnect between write and read. So the MIDI spy showing two separate handshakes means the test is running multiple times or there's an issue with how I'm interpreting the timestamps.

Actually wait, looking more carefully at the timestamps:
- 30:20 - One test run
- 30:24 - Different test run (3 seconds later)
- 30:47 - Another test run (23 seconds later)

These are from DIFFERENT test runs! The test must be failing and retrying.

So within a SINGLE test run at 30:20-30:22:
1. 30:20: Connect
2. 30:21: Select slot 1, write "RT20954"
3. 30:22: Read from slot 1, get... "RT51506"??

Wait no, there's another connection at 30:24. Let me re-examine the logs more carefully.

Actually, I see now. Looking at line starting with `30:22.341`:
```
30:22.341 [DEST] LCXL3 1 MIDI In : SysEx Start : F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 40 00 01 F7
```

This is a read request with `40 00 01` - page 0, slot 1.

And the response at 30:22.345 shows "RT51506".

But this is BEFORE the handshake at 30:24. So this read is happening in the SAME session as the write at 30:21.

So the write/read sequence within one connection is:
1. 30:21.087: Write "RT20954" page 0
2. 30:21.120: ACK page 0
3. 30:21.121: Write "RT20954" page 3
4. 30:21.203: ACK page 3  
5. 30:22.341: Read request page 0 slot 1


6. 30:22.345: Response with "RT51506" (WRONG!)

I suspect a critical device communication issue. The system acknowledges writes but fails to actually save data to the intended slot. This points to potential protocol complexities - perhaps requiring an explicit save command or revealing nuanced differences between temporary and permanent write mechanisms. The discrepancy between write acknowledgment and actual slot content suggests a deeper communication protocol challenge that needs investigation.

I'll trace the sequence of commands around the write to understand the full interaction pattern.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

**The Write IS Working - But The Read Uses a Different Method!**

Looking at the sequence at 30:22, after our successful write:

```
30:22.341 [DEST] MIDI In: 40 00 01  ← Read request with EXPLICIT SLOT byte (slot 1)
30:22.345 [SRC] MIDI Out: "RT51506" ← Wrong data!
```

The read command uses an **explicit slot parameter** (`40 00 01` = read page 0, slot 1), but earlier reads used DAW port selection with **no slot parameter** (`40 00 00`). This might be the bug - the slot byte in the read command might mean something different than we think, or we need to use DAW port selection for reads too.

Let me check what a successful web editor write+read looks like to understand the correct read protocol for reading back what we just wrote.

<think><details>The user wants me to continue investigating. I've discovered that:

1. The write IS working - we're sending "RT20954" and the device acknowledges it
2. But the read is getting wrong data - it gets "RT51506" instead of "RT20954"
3. The read command at 30:22 uses `40 00 01` (read page 0, slot 1 explicitly)
4. Earlier successful reads used `40 00 00` with DAW port selection

I need to find out what the correct read protocol is. Let me look for a web editor sequence that writes and then reads back to see what the web editor does.

Looking at the spy log history, I should check if the web editor uses DAW port selection for reads after writes, or if it uses the slot byte differently.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>So I see that `B6 1E 07` means the device reported slot 2 (CC value 7 = slot 7-5 = slot 2). This confirms our write went to slot 2, not slot 1.

Wait, looking at the test output earlier, it said:
```
[DawPortController] Selecting slot 1 (physical 2, CC value 7)
[DawPortController] Device reports current slot: 2
```

So the test is selecting slot 1 (0-indexed), which is physical slot 2, which is CC value 7. That's correct.

But then the write at 30:21 shows "RT20954" being written. And then at 30:22 the read shows "RT51506" being read back.

Let me check what slot the read is trying to read from. At 30:22:
```
30:22.341 [DEST] MIDI In: 40 00 01
```

That's `40 00 01` which in our protocol is: read operation, page 0, slot 1. But wait, we wrote to slot 1 (0-indexed), so this should be correct...

Actually, I need to check the DAW port selection before the read. Let me look at that.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Looking at 30:22, I see the DAW port selection happened (`B6 1E 07` = slot 2), but then the read used `40 00 01` (slot byte = 1). **This is the bug!**

The read command's slot byte is **NOT ignored** like we thought. It's reading from the slot specified in the SysEx byte (slot 1), but we wrote to the DAW-port-selected slot (slot 2). The slot byte in the read command overrides the DAW port selection!

Let me check how the read protocol actually works:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>So the read request uses:
```typescript
slot,             // Slot byte (actual slot indicator, 0-14)
```

The code comment says "actual slot indicator" which suggests it directly specifies which slot to read. The write protocol uses DAW port selection, but the read protocol might use BOTH:
- DAW port selection tells the device which slot is "active"
- But the slot byte in the read command can read from ANY slot

Let me check what happens with reads in the web editor - do they always read from the DAW-port-selected slot or do they use the slot byte?

Looking at the earlier traffic at 30:24, 30:47, and 30:52, I see reads with:
```
30:24.981 [DEST] MIDI In: 40 00 00  ← Reading with slot byte 0
30:47.398 [DEST] MIDI In: 40 00 00  ← Reading with slot byte 0  
30:52.196 [DEST] MIDI In: 40 00 00  ← Reading with slot byte 0
```

All these reads use slot byte 0, but they successfully read "CHANNEVE" which was in a different slot (slot 6 based on the DAW port response `B6 1E 06`).

So the pattern is:
- **Reads**: Slot byte = 0 (ignore slot byte, use DAW-port-selected slot)
- **Writes**: DAW port selection (no slot byte in write command)

But our test at 30:22 sent:
```
30:22.341 [DEST] MIDI In: 40 00 01  ← Reading with slot byte 1 (WRONG!)
```

This is reading from the explicit slot 1, not from the DAW-port-selected slot 2!

The fix: **Always use slot byte 0 for reads** to read from the DAW-port-selected slot.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

**FOUND THE BUG!**

Looking at the traffic, I can see:

**Successful reads** (getting "CHANNEVE"):
```
30:24: DAW port → B6 1E 06 (slot 6), Read → 40 00 00 (slot byte 0)
30:47: DAW port → B6 1E 06 (slot 6), Read → 40 00 00 (slot byte 0)
```

**Failed read** (our test):
```
30:21: DAW port → B6 1E 07 (slot 2), Write "RT20954" ✓
30:22: DAW port → B6 1E 07 (slot 2), Read → 40 00 01 (slot byte 1) ❌
```

**The bug**: Read commands with slot byte > 0 read from the **explicit slot**, ignoring DAW port selection. When slot byte = 0, it reads from the **DAW-port-selected slot**.

We wrote to slot 2 (via DAW port), but read from slot 1 (via explicit slot byte), getting the wrong data!

**Fix**: Always use slot byte 0 in read requests to read from the DAW-port-selected slot.
