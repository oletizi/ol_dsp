+# BUG-001: Custom Mode Writes Always Target Slot 0
+
+**Status**: Open
+**Severity**: High
+**Component**: @oletizi/launch-control-xl3 library
+**Version**: 1.20.0
+**Date Reported**: 2025-10-09
+**Reporter**: Claude Code Analysis
+
+## Summary
+Custom mode write operations always write to slot 0 regardless of the slot parameter passed to `writeCustomMode()`. This makes it impossible to write custom modes to any slot other than the first slot.
+
+## Environment
+- **Library**: `@oletizi/launch-control-xl3` v1.20.0
+- **Affected Code**: `src/core/SysExParser.ts` line 1000-1034
+- **Build System**: Vite building from `src/` directory
+- **Device**: Novation Launch Control XL3
+
+## Expected Behavior
+When calling `device.writeCustomMode(slot, mode)`:
+- Slot 0 → mode appears in physical slot 1
+- Slot 3 → mode appears in physical slot 4
+- Slot 7 → mode appears in physical slot 8
+- etc.
+
+## Actual Behavior
+When calling `device.writeCustomMode(slot, mode)` with ANY slot value:
+- **All writes go to slot 0** (physical slot 1)
+- User-selected slot is ignored
+- Subsequent writes overwrite the same slot
+
+## Root Cause Analysis
+
+### The Bug
+In `src/core/SysExParser.ts`, the `buildCustomModeWriteRequest()` method **hardcodes** the slot byte to `0x00`:
+
+```typescript
+// Line 1000-1034 in src/core/SysExParser.ts
+static buildCustomModeWriteRequest(page: number, modeData: CustomModeMessage): number[] {
+  // ... validation code ...
+
+  return [
+    0xF0,             // SysEx start
+    0x00, 0x20, 0x29, // Manufacturer ID (Novation)
+    0x02,             // Device ID (Launch Control XL 3)
+    0x15,             // Command (Custom mode)
+    0x05,             // Sub-command
+    0x00,             // Reserved
+    0x45,             // Write operation with data
+    page,             // Page number (0 or 3 for write operations)
+    0x00,             // ❌ BUG: Flag byte hardcoded to 0x00 - should be slot!
+    ...encodedData,   // Encoded custom mode data
+    0xF7              // SysEx end
+  ];
+}
+```
+
+**The hardcoded `0x00` at byte position 10 should be `modeData.slot`.**
+
+### Evidence Chain
+
+1. **UI Layer (Verified ✅)**: Editor.tsx correctly passes `activeSlotIndex` to device
+   ```typescript
+   // Line 218 in Editor.tsx
+   await device.saveCustomMode(activeSlotIndex, lcxl3Mode);
+   // Console logs confirm: activeSlotIndex = 3 (number type)
+   ```
+
+2. **Device Layer (Verified ✅)**: DeviceManager receives and validates slot
+   ```typescript
+   // Line 785 in DeviceManager.ts
+   async writeCustomMode(slot: number, mode: CustomMode): Promise<void> {
+     const modeData = { slot, name, controls, colors, labels };
+     const validatedModeData = this.validateCustomModeData(modeData);
+     // validatedModeData.slot = 3 ✅
+   ```
+
+3. **SysEx Layer (BUG ❌)**: buildCustomModeWriteRequest ignores `modeData.slot`
+   ```typescript
+   // Lines 856, 867 in DeviceManager.ts
+   const page0Data = { ...validatedModeData, controls: page0Controls };
+   const page0Message = SysExParser.buildCustomModeWriteRequest(0, page0Data);
+   // page0Data.slot = 3 ✅
+   // BUT buildCustomModeWriteRequest hardcodes 0x00 instead! ❌
+   ```
+
+### Protocol Comparison
+
+**READ Request** (working correctly):
+```
+F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 40 [PAGE] [SLOT] F7
+                                    ^^^^
+```
+
+**WRITE Request** (bug):
+```
+F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 45 [page] 0x00 [data] F7
+                                   ^^^^
+                                   Should be [slot]!
+```
+
+### Additional Evidence
+
+There appears to be a **working implementation** in `package/src/core/SysExParser.ts`:
+
+```typescript
+static buildCustomModeWriteRequest(slot: number, modeData: CustomModeMessage): number[] {
+  // ... validation ...
+
+  return [
+    0xF0,             // SysEx start
+    0x00, 0x20, 0x29, // Manufacturer ID (Novation)
+    0x02,             // Device ID (Launch Control XL 3)
+    0x15,             // Command (Custom mode)
+    0x05,             // Sub-command
+    0x00,             // Reserved
+    0x45,             // Write operation
+    slot,             // ✅ CORRECT: Uses slot parameter directly!
+    ...encodedData,
+    0xF7              // SysEx end
+  ];
+}
+```
+
+**However, Vite builds from `src/` (vite.config.ts line 16), not `package/src/`, so the broken code gets published.**
+
+## Reproduction Steps
+
+1. Connect to Launch Control XL3 device
+2. Open web editor at http://localhost:5173
+3. Select slot 3 from the slot selector
+4. Modify a mode
+5. Click "Send to Device"
+6. **Observe**: Mode appears in physical slot 1, not slot 4
+7. Select slot 7, send again
+8. **Observe**: Mode again appears in slot 1 (overwrites previous)
+
+## Debugging Steps Taken
+
+1. ✅ Verified UI passes correct `activeSlotIndex` (console logs show `activeSlotIndex: 3`)
+2. ✅ Verified DeviceManager receives correct slot (modeData.slot = 3)
+3. ✅ Verified slot is included in page0Data spread to buildCustomModeWriteRequest
+4. ❌ **Found**: buildCustomModeWriteRequest hardcodes `0x00` instead of using `modeData.slot`
+
+## Suggested Fix
+
+### Option 1: Use modeData.slot (Minimal Change)
+
+```typescript
+// src/core/SysExParser.ts line 1000
+static buildCustomModeWriteRequest(page: number, modeData: CustomModeMessage): number[] {
+  if (page < 0 || page > 3) {
+    throw new Error('Page must be 0-3');
+  }
+
+  // Validate the custom mode data
+  this.validateCustomModeData(modeData);
+
+  // ✅ FIX: Extract slot from modeData
+  const slot = modeData.slot ?? 0;
+  if (slot < 0 || slot > 14) {
+    throw new Error('Custom mode slot must be 0-14 (slot 15 is reserved for immutable factory content)');
+  }
+
+  // Encode the custom mode data
+  const encodedData = this.encodeCustomModeData(modeData);
+
+  return [
+    0xF0,             // SysEx start
+    0x00, 0x20, 0x29, // Manufacturer ID (Novation)
+    0x02,             // Device ID (Launch Control XL 3)
+    0x15,             // Command (Custom mode)
+    0x05,             // Sub-command
+    0x00,             // Reserved
+    0x45,             // Write operation with data
+    page,             // Page number (0 or 3 for write operations)
+    slot,             // ✅ FIX: Use slot from modeData instead of hardcoded 0x00
+    ...encodedData,   // Encoded custom mode data
+    0xF7              // SysEx end
+  ];
+}
+```
+
+### Option 2: Match package/src/ Implementation (Preferred)
+
+Copy the working implementation from `package/src/core/SysExParser.ts` to `src/core/SysExParser.ts`, which takes `slot` as the first parameter:
+
+```typescript
+static buildCustomModeWriteRequest(slot: number, modeData: CustomModeMessage): number[] {
+  if (slot < 0 || slot > 14) {
+    throw new Error('Custom mode slot must be 0-14 (slot 15 is reserved for immutable factory content)');
+  }
+
+  // ... validation and encoding ...
+
+  return [
+    0xF0,             // SysEx start
+    0x00, 0x20, 0x29, // Manufacturer ID (Novation)
+    0x02,             // Device ID (Launch Control XL 3)
+    0x15,             // Command (Custom mode)
+    0x05,             // Sub-command
+    0x00,             // Reserved
+    0x45,             // Write operation
+    slot,             // ✅ Slot parameter directly
+    ...encodedData,
+    0xF7              // SysEx end
+  ];
+}
+```
+
+Then update DeviceManager.ts calls:
+
+```typescript
+// Line 856
+const page0Message = SysExParser.buildCustomModeWriteRequest(slot, page0Data);
+
+// Line 867
+const page3Message = SysExParser.buildCustomModeWriteRequest(slot, page3Data);
+```
+
+## Testing
+
+After fixing, verify with:
+
+```bash
+# In library directory
+cd /Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-control/modules/launch-control-xl3
+
+# Rebuild library
+pnpm build
+
+# Run integration test (requires JUCE MIDI server)
+pnpm env:juce-server  # In one terminal
+pnpm test:slot-copy   # In another terminal
+
+# Expected output:
+# ✅ Slot 0 successfully copied to slot 7
+# ✅ Data integrity verified - all controls match!
+```
+
+Then in web app:
+
+```bash
+# In web app directory
+cd /Users/orion/work/xl3-web
+
+# Link local library (or wait for npm publish)
+pnpm link ../ol_dsp/modules/audio-control/modules/launch-control-xl3
+
+# Test manually:
+# 1. Start dev server: pnpm dev
+# 2. Select slot 3
+# 3. Send mode
+# 4. Verify it appears in physical slot 4
+```
+
+## Impact
+
+- **Severity**: High - Core functionality broken
+- **User Impact**: Users cannot use slots 1-14, limiting device to 1/15th capacity
+- **Workaround**: None - feature is completely non-functional
+- **Data Loss Risk**: Low - only overwrites slot 0, other slots remain intact
+
+## Related Files
+
+**Library** (`/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-control/modules/launch-control-xl3/`):
+- `src/core/SysExParser.ts:1000-1034` - Contains the bug
+- `src/device/DeviceManager.ts:856,867` - Calls the buggy method
+- `package/src/core/SysExParser.ts` - Contains working implementation (NOT built)
+- `vite.config.ts:16` - Build configuration (builds from `src/`)
+- `utils/test-slot-copy.ts` - Integration test that should catch this
+
+**Web App** (`/Users/orion/work/xl3-web/`):
+- `src/pages/Editor.tsx:218` - Calls device.saveCustomMode
+- `src/hooks/useLCXL3Device.ts` - Device hook
+- `package.json:20` - Library dependency version
+
+## Architecture Notes
+
+The library has two source directories:
+1. **`src/`** - Built by Vite and published to npm (contains bug)
+2. **`package/src/`** - Older code with working implementation (NOT built)
+
+This suggests:
+- The bug was introduced when updating `src/` without porting the fix from `package/src/`
+- OR `package/src/` contains a previous fix that was never merged to `src/`
+- The two directories should be consolidated to prevent drift
+
+## Resolution Plan
+
+1. ✅ **Immediate**: Document bug (this file)
+2. ⏳ **Next**: Fix `src/core/SysExParser.ts` (library team)
+3. ⏳ **Then**: Rebuild and test library
+4. ⏳ **Then**: Publish new version to npm
+5. ⏳ **Finally**: Update web app dependency and verify
+
+## Notes
+
+- Bug discovered during investigation of slot selection feature
+- Confirmed via debug logging that UI and DeviceManager layers work correctly
+- Protocol comparison with READ requests confirms expected format
+- Integration test `test-slot-copy.ts` exists but requires JUCE server to run

+# After-Action Report: BUG-001 Slot Write Failure
+
+**Date**: 2025-10-09
+**Incident**: Claude Code incorrectly reported slot selection as working
+**Severity**: Critical - Misinformation led to false confidence in broken feature
+**Reporter**: Claude Code (self-report)
+
+---
+
+## Executive Summary
+
+Claude Code was asked: "Do we support choosing a slot to send a custom mode to? And, if so, do we have proof that it works?"
+
+**Response Given**: "YES - Library Supports Slot Selection" with "proof" cited.
+
+**Actual Reality**: The feature is completely broken. All writes go to slot 0 regardless of parameter.
+
+**Root Cause**: Insufficient verification methodology. Presence of API methods and test files was mistaken for proof of functionality.
+
+---
+
+## Timeline of Events
+
+### 2025-10-09 22:31 - Initial Question
+User asks: "Do we support choosing a slot to send a custom mode to?"
+
+### 2025-10-09 22:32 - Evidence Collection
+Claude performs code search:
+- ✅ Found `writeCustomMode(slot, mode)` API method in multiple files
+- ✅ Found test scripts: `test-round-trip.ts`, `test-slot-debug.ts`
+- ✅ Found backup files in `backup/` directory from slot 1
+- ✅ Found CLI `load-mode <slot>` command
+
+### 2025-10-09 22:33 - Incorrect Conclusion
+Claude concludes: "✅ YES - We Have Proof It Works"
+
+Evidence cited:
+1. Test scripts exist that write to slots 0, 1, 7, 14
+2. Backup files prove successful slot 1 reads
+3. API methods accept slot parameters
+
+### 2025-10-09 22:35 - Feature Enhancement Work
+Based on false confidence:
+- Added CLI `write-mode` command
+- Added `--slot` argument to backup script
+- Created `test-slot-copy.ts` integration test
+- Updated PROTOCOL.md claiming slot selection works
+
+### 2025-10-09 22:52 - Bug Report Presented
+User presents bug report showing:
+- Line 1030 in `SysExParser.ts` hardcodes `0x00`
+- All writes go to slot 0
+- Feature never worked
+
+### 2025-10-09 22:53 - Truth Acknowledged
+Claude admits error and reads actual code.
+
+---
+
+## What Went Wrong
+
+### 1. **Mistook API Surface for Implementation**
+
+**Error**: Assumed that because `writeCustomMode(slot, mode)` accepts a `slot` parameter, the slot must be used.
+
+**Reality**: The parameter is accepted but ignored. The SysEx builder hardcodes `0x00`.
+
+**Lesson**: API signatures are not proof of functionality. Implementation must be verified.
+
+### 2. **Mistook Test Existence for Test Execution**
+
+**Error**: Found `test-round-trip.ts` with code like:
+```typescript
+const testSlots = [0, 1, 7, 14];
+for (const slot of testSlots) {
+  await device.writeCustomMode(slot, testMode);
+}
+```
+
+Assumed this proved slot selection works.
+
+**Reality**:
+- Test was never executed (requires JUCE server)
+- Test doesn't verify which PHYSICAL slot receives the data
+- Test only verifies read-back data matches written data
+- If all writes go to slot 0, reading from slot 0 would "pass"
+
+**Lesson**: Test code is not proof of functionality. Test execution and verification are required.
+
+### 3. **Mistook Successful Reads for Successful Writes**
+
+**Error**: Found backup files like `slot-1-2025-10-01.json` proving successful reads from slot 1.
+
+**Reality**:
+- Reading slots works correctly (uses correct slot byte at position 10)
+- Writing slots is broken (hardcodes 0x00 at position 10)
+- These are separate code paths
+
+**Lesson**: One feature working doesn't prove related feature works. Verify each independently.
+
+### 4. **Created Test Without Running It**
+
+**Error**: Created `test-slot-copy.ts` claiming it would prove slot selection works.
+
+**Reality**:
+- Test requires JUCE MIDI server (wasn't running)
+- Test would fail with current code (all writes go to slot 0)
+- Test was never executed to verify the claim
+
+**Lesson**: Don't claim a test proves something works until the test has been run and passed.
+
+### 5. **Updated Documentation Based on Assumptions**
+
+**Error**: Updated `PROTOCOL.md` claiming:
+- "Slot selection uses SysEx slot byte directly" ✅ TRUE for reads
+- "DAW port protocol is NOT required" ✅ TRUE
+- Implied the implementation was correct ❌ FALSE for writes
+
+**Reality**: The protocol understanding was correct, but the implementation was broken.
+
+**Lesson**: Protocol specification is separate from implementation compliance. Verify code matches spec.
+
+---
+
+## Evidence Misinterpretation
+
+### What Was Actually Verified
+
+| Evidence | What It Proves | What I Claimed |
+|----------|----------------|----------------|
+| `writeCustomMode(slot, mode)` exists | API accepts parameter | Slot selection works ❌ |
+| `test-round-trip.ts` exists | Test code was written | Test proves functionality ❌ |
+| `backup/slot-1-*.json` exists | Reading slot 1 works | Writing slots works ❌ |
+| CLI `load-mode <slot>` exists | Reading is implemented | Writing is implemented ❌ |
+
+### What Was Never Verified
+
+- [ ] **Actual SysEx bytes sent** - Never inspected byte 10 in write messages
+- [ ] **Test execution results** - Tests require JUCE server, never run
+- [ ] **Physical device verification** - Never checked which slot actually received data
+- [ ] **Code path inspection** - Never read `buildCustomModeWriteRequest()` implementation
+- [ ] **Read vs Write symmetry** - Never compared read and write code paths
+
+---
+
+## How The Bug Should Have Been Caught
+
+### At Code Review Stage
+
+Read `src/core/SysExParser.ts:1000-1034`:
+
+```typescript
+static buildCustomModeWriteRequest(page: number, modeData: CustomModeMessage): number[] {
+  // ...
+  return [
+    0xF0,             // SysEx start
+    0x00, 0x20, 0x29, // Manufacturer ID (Novation)
+    0x02,             // Device ID (Launch Control XL 3)
+    0x15,             // Command (Custom mode)
+    0x05,             // Sub-command
+    0x00,             // Reserved
+    0x45,             // Write operation with data
+    page,             // Page number (0 or 3 for write operations)
+    0x00,             // ❌ FLAG BYTE HARDCODED - SHOULD BE SLOT!
+    ...encodedData,
+    0xF7
+  ];
+}
+```
+
+**Observation**:
+- Method signature: `buildCustomModeWriteRequest(page: number, modeData: CustomModeMessage)`
+- Slot is NOT in the signature
+- `modeData` contains slot, but it's never used
+- Byte position 10 is hardcoded to `0x00`
+
+**Compare to READ method** (lines 966-993):
+
+```typescript
+static buildCustomModeReadRequest(slot: number, page: number = 0): number[] {
+  // ...
+  return [
+    0xF0,
+    0x00, 0x20, 0x29,
+    0x02,
+    0x15,
+    0x05,
+    0x00,
+    0x40,             // Read operation
+    page === 0 ? 0x00 : 0x03,
+    slot,             // ✅ SLOT PARAMETER USED CORRECTLY
+    0xF7
+  ];
+}
+```
+
+**Immediate red flag**: Read uses `slot` parameter, write uses `0x00` hardcode.
+
+### At Test Design Stage
+
+The test `test-slot-copy.ts` has a critical flaw:
+
+```typescript
+// Step 1: Read from slot 0
+const sourceMode = await device.readCustomMode(0);
+
+// Step 2: Write to slot 7
+await device.writeCustomMode(7, sourceMode);
+
+// Step 3: Read back from slot 7
+const targetMode = await device.readCustomMode(7);
+
+// Step 4: Verify they match
+if (sourceMode.name === targetMode.name) { /* PASS */ }
+```
+
+**Bug**: If write ignores the slot parameter and always writes to slot 0, then:
+1. Write to "slot 7" actually writes to slot 0 (overwrites source)
+2. Read from slot 7 returns whatever was already there (old data)
+3. Test compares old data in slot 7 vs source data
+4. Test would FAIL (correctly detecting the bug)
+
+**However**: Test was never run, so bug was never caught.
+
+### At Protocol Verification Stage
+
+Should have compared WRITE protocol to READ protocol:
+
+**READ** (working):
+```
+F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 40 [PAGE] [SLOT] F7
+                                    ^^^^
+                                    Slot parameter
+```
+
+**WRITE** (broken):
+```
+F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 45 [page] 0x00 [data] F7
+                                   ^^^^
+                                   Hardcoded 0x00!
+```
+
+**Immediate observation**: Write doesn't include slot parameter.
+
+---
+
+## Correct Verification Methodology
+
+### What Should Have Been Done
+
+1. **Read the implementation** - Don't trust signatures, read the code
+   ```bash
+   # Should have done this first:
+   grep -A 20 "buildCustomModeWriteRequest" src/core/SysExParser.ts
+   ```
+
+2. **Compare read vs write** - If read works, write should be symmetric
+   ```bash
+   # Should have compared:
+   diff <(grep -A 15 "buildCustomModeReadRequest") \
+        <(grep -A 15 "buildCustomModeWriteRequest")
+   ```
+
+3. **Run the tests** - Don't assume tests prove anything without running them
+   ```bash
+   # Should have verified:
+   pnpm env:juce-server  # Start test server
+   pnpm test:slot-copy   # Run actual test
+   ```
+
+4. **Inspect actual bytes** - Log or capture the SysEx messages
+   ```typescript
+   // Should have added:
+   console.log('Write message:', message.map(b => '0x' + b.toString(16)));
+   ```
+
+5. **Physical verification** - Check device display to see which slot changed
+   - After write to "slot 7", check if device shows slot 7 or slot 0 changed
+   - This is the ground truth

+
+## Impact Assessment
+
+### Direct Impact
+
+- ❌ User received false confidence in broken feature
+- ❌ Additional features built on false assumption (CLI command, backup slot arg)
+- ❌ Documentation updated claiming incorrect behavior
+- ❌ Test created that would have caught bug, but never run
+
+### Indirect Impact
+
+- ❌ Time wasted building features that depend on broken foundation
+- ❌ Potential for bug to reach production if not caught
+- ❌ Erosion of trust in AI-provided analysis
+
+### Severity Factors
+
+**Why This Was Critical**:
+1. **High Confidence Assertion**: "✅ YES - We Have Proof It Works"
+2. **Multiple Forms of "Proof"**: Test scripts, backup files, API methods
+3. **Continued Building**: Added features without verifying foundation
+4. **Documentation Updates**: Claimed protocol understanding was correct
+
+---
+
+## Corrective Actions
+
+### Immediate (Today)
+
+- [x] Acknowledge error to user
+- [ ] Fix `buildCustomModeWriteRequest()` to use slot parameter
+- [ ] Update `DeviceManager.writeCustomMode()` to pass slot
+- [ ] Run `test-slot-copy.ts` to verify fix works
+- [ ] Verify physical device behavior
+
+### Short-Term (This Week)
+
+- [ ] Add pre-commit test that verifies read/write symmetry
+- [ ] Add integration test that verifies physical slot selection
+- [ ] Document required verification steps for protocol claims
+- [ ] Review all other protocol implementations for similar issues
+
+### Long-Term (Ongoing)
+
+- [ ] Never claim functionality works without execution proof
+- [ ] Always read implementation code, not just signatures
+- [ ] Always run tests before citing them as proof
+- [ ] Always verify physical behavior for hardware interfaces
+- [ ] Maintain healthy skepticism of untested code
+
+---
+
+## Lessons Learned
+
+### For AI Agents
+
+1. **Code Existence ≠ Code Correctness**
+   - Finding a function doesn't prove it works
+   - Read the implementation, don't trust the signature
+
+2. **Test Existence ≠ Test Validation**
+   - Test code is not proof of functionality
+   - Tests must be executed and pass to prove anything
+
+3. **Related Feature Working ≠ Target Feature Working**
+   - Reading slots working doesn't prove writing slots works
+   - Verify each code path independently
+
+4. **API Surface ≠ Implementation Completeness**
+   - Methods can accept parameters and ignore them
+   - Check if parameters are actually used in implementation
+
+5. **Never Claim Proof Without Verification**
+   - "Proof" requires execution results, not code existence
+   - Be explicit about what was and wasn't verified
+
+### For Software Engineering
+
+1. **Symmetry Checks Matter**
+   - If read and write are inverse operations, their implementations should be symmetric
+   - Asymmetry is a code smell
+
+2. **Integration Tests Must Run**
+   - Tests in the repo that aren't in CI are effectively not tests
+   - Require test environment setup or skip verification
+
+3. **Physical Verification for Hardware**
+   - Software tests can pass while hardware behaves incorrectly
+   - Always verify with actual device when possible
+
+4. **Protocol vs Implementation**
+   - Understanding the protocol doesn't mean code follows it
+   - Verify implementation matches specification
+
+---
+
+## Verification Checklist (Going Forward)
+
+Before claiming any feature works, verify:
+
+- [ ] **Read the implementation** - Not just the signature
+- [ ] **Execute the tests** - Don't assume they pass
+- [ ] **Check symmetry** - Compare related operations
+- [ ] **Inspect actual data** - Log or capture real messages
+- [ ] **Physical verification** - Test with actual hardware if applicable
+- [ ] **Negative testing** - Verify failure cases fail correctly
+
+Before updating documentation:
+
+- [ ] **Code matches spec** - Implementation follows protocol
+- [ ] **Tests verify claim** - Specific tests prove specific claims
+- [ ] **Evidence is current** - Based on latest code, not assumptions
