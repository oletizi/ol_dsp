 #### Feature MVP.3 Testing Requirements
 
-- [x] There is a "one-click" pnpm script (test:fetch-mode:node) that a developer may use to fetch custom modes via Node MIDI

+- [x] There is a "one-click" pnpm script (test:fetch-mode:node) that a developer may use to fetch custom modes via Node
+  MIDI with a connected device and reports success or failure
 - [x] The test script displays custom mode details including control mappings, LED colors, and labels
 - [x] Error handling provides clear troubleshooting guidance for common issues
 
+### Feature MVP.4: Device Custom Mode Send
+
+- [ ] The library API offers a function to send data to update the custom mode in the connected device
+- [ ] The fetch function listens for and parses response message(s) from the device and returns a response to the API
+  client indicating success or failure
+- [ ] The send function handles timeouts and error cases gracefully

+#### Feature MVP.4 Testing Requirements
+
+- [ ] There is a "one-click" pnpm script (test:send-mode:node) that a developer may use to send custom mode data via
+  MIDI in a node context to a connected device
+- [ ] There is also a "one-click" pnpm script (test:round-trip:node) that a developer may use to send custom mode data
+  via MIDI in a node context to a connected device; then, on success, it fetches the same data from the connected
+  device (via the fetch function) and ensures the fetched data is the same as the sent data
