I'll analyze the staged git changes to create a conventional commit message.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Show staged changes for commit message

`git diff --staged`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Let me check if there are any changes at all:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check current git status

`git status`

Result:

```
On branch issues/40
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/issues/40'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   .specstory/history/2025-10-17_01-47-39Z-warmup.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

There are no staged changes. You need to stage files first using `git add` before I can analyze them for a commit message.
