Analyze these staged git changes and output ONLY a single-line conventional commit message (type(scope): description). No explanations.

I'll analyze the staged changes to create a conventional commit message.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Show staged changes for commit message

`git diff --staged`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check git status for staged changes

`git status`

Result:

```
On branch feat/cc-mapping-360
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/feat/cc-mapping-360'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   docs/1.21/360/status.md
	modified:   modules/controller-workflow/vitest.config.ts

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	modules/controller-workflow/coverage-output.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

There are no staged changes. You need to stage the changes first before I can analyze them for a commit message. Would you like me to:

1. Stage all modified files and create a commit?
2. Help you stage specific files?

Please let me know which files you'd like to commit.
