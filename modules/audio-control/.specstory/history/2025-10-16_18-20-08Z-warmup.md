I'm Claude Haiku, a file search specialist for Claude Code. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore the audio-control codebase.

I understand the project structure and guidelines:

- **audio-control monorepo** with modules for MIDI mapping (Ardour, canonical formats)
- **TypeScript-focused** with strict type safety and dependency injection patterns
- **Key requirement**: Use `@/` import patterns for internal modules
- **Critical protocol**: Always verify file operations with bash commands before claiming completion
- **Architecture**: Interface-first design, no class inheritance, composition over inheritance
- **Testing**: Vitest with high coverage, deterministic tests, dependency injection for mocking

Current context:
- Branch: `fix/36-take-3`
- Working directory: `/Users/orion/work/ol_dsp/modules/audio-control`
- Recent work on Issue #36 related to Launch Control XL3 device ID

I'm ready to help with:
- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code with regex
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Exploring the codebase structure

What would you like me to search for or explore?
