# Issue #32 Implementation Plan

**Issue:** [launch-control-xl3] SysExParser incorrectly parses 0x40 bytes as control IDs in READ responses
**Created:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** Planning

## Executive Summary

The `SysExParser.parseReadResponseFormat` method contains a critical bug in "Step 3" (lines 630-677) that incorrectly interprets `0x40` data bytes as control ID markers when parsing READ responses from the Launch Control XL3 device.

**Root Cause:** The parser scans the entire data stream for `0x40` bytes and treats the following byte as a control ID if it falls in the valid range (0x10-0x3F). However, `0x40` bytes are actually **data values within `0x48` control structures** (specifically at byte offset +7, the minValue field), not separate control markers.

**Impact:**
- Wrong CC numbers for some controls (e.g., Encoder 8 shows CC 20 instead of CC 41)
- Missing custom labels (e.g., "Resonance", "Osc 2 Shape")
- Creation of "fake" control definitions with CC 0

## Problem Analysis

### Current Implementation (INCORRECT)

**File:** `src/core/SysExParser.ts:630-677`

```typescript
// Step 3: Process 0x40 short-format controls (unconfigured controls with default CH0/CC0)
// These appear mixed with 0x48 controls in the device response
if (ccData.length > 0) {
  // Build set of control IDs we already have from 0x48 parsing
  const existingControlIds = new Set(controls.map(c => c.controlId));

  console.log(`[parseReadResponseFormat] Found ${ccData.length} 0x40 entries, ${existingControlIds.size} already parsed from 0x48`);

  // Parse 0x40 markers to get control IDs
  const shortFormatControls: number[] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length - 1; i++) {
    if (data[i] === 0x40) {
      const possibleControlId = data[i + 1];
      // Valid control IDs are 0x10-0x3F
      if (possibleControlId !== undefined && possibleControlId >= 0x10 && possibleControlId <= 0x3F) {
        shortFormatControls.push(possibleControlId);  // ❌ BUG: Treating data bytes as control IDs
      }
    }
  }
  // ... creates fake controls with CC 0
}
```

### Why This Is Wrong

1. **In READ responses, `0x40` bytes are NOT control ID markers** - they appear as data within `0x48` control structures

2. **The `0x48` control definition is 11 bytes:**
   ```
   Position:  0    1          2        3       4        5       6       7         8         9
   Bytes:     0x48 controlId  defType  ?       channel  param1  ?       minValue  ccNumber  maxValue
              ^^^^                                                       ^^^^^^^^
              marker                                                     This is where 0x40 appears as DATA
   ```

3. **Example of the bug in action:**
   - Parser finds `0x40 0x35` in the data stream
   - `0x35` (53 decimal) is in range 0x10-0x3F
   - Parser incorrectly creates a fake control with ID `0x35` and CC `0`
   - This corrupts the control list

4. **What `0x40` actually is:** It's a minValue of 64 (0x40 = 64 decimal) for some control in the custom mode

### Correct Implementation (Step 2 Only)

**File:** `src/core/SysExParser.ts:576-626`

```typescript
// Step 2: Parse 0x48 control definition sections (device stores as 0x48, not 0x49)
for (let i = startPos; i < data.length - 9; i++) {
  if (data[i] === 0x48) {
    const controlId = data[i + 1];
    const defType = data[i + 2];
    const channel = data[i + 4];
    const param1 = data[i + 5];
    const minValue = data[i + 7];  // ← This is where 0x40 appears as DATA
    const ccNumber = data[i + 8];   // ← Correct CC number
    const maxValue = data[i + 9];

    // Validates and creates control with correct CC number
    // ...
  }
}
```

**This step correctly parses ALL controls from READ responses. Step 3 is unnecessary and harmful.**

### Evidence from Kaitai Struct Specification

**File:** `formats/launch_control_xl3.ksy:95-118`

The Kaitai Struct format file (single source of truth) defines control definitions as:

```yaml
control_definition:
  seq:
    - id: control_type
      type: u1
    - id: control_id
      type: u1
    - id: midi_channel
      type: u1
    - id: cc_number
      type: u1
    - id: min_value        # ← This is position +7 where 0x40 can appear
      type: u1
    - id: max_value
      type: u1
    - id: behavior
      type: u1
```

**No mention of `0x40` as a separate control marker.** Only `0x48` markers are documented for READ responses.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Code Fix

**File:** `src/core/SysExParser.ts`

**Change:** Remove lines 630-677 (Step 3 parsing)

**Before:**
```typescript
    console.log(`[parseReadResponseFormat] Parsed ${controlsFound} controls (last at position ${lastPosition}, loop ended at ${data.length - 9})`);

    // Step 3: Process 0x40 short-format controls (unconfigured controls with default CH0/CC0)
    // These appear mixed with 0x48 controls in the device response
    if (ccData.length > 0) {
      // ... 47 lines of incorrect parsing logic ...
    }
  }

  /**
   * Get default color for a control based on its ID range
   */
```

**After:**
```typescript
    console.log(`[parseReadResponseFormat] Parsed ${controlsFound} controls (last at position ${lastPosition}, loop ended at ${data.length - 9})`);
  }

  /**
   * Get default color for a control based on its ID range
   */
```

**Rationale:** Step 2 (`0x48` control parsing) already correctly parses ALL controls from READ responses. Step 3 is based on an incorrect assumption about the protocol.

### Phase 2: Documentation Updates (MANDATORY)

According to module guidelines in `docs/MAINTENANCE.md`, the following files MUST be updated:

#### 2.1 Update `docs/PROTOCOL.md`

**Location:** Version history section

**Add:**
```markdown
## Version History

### v1.6 (2025-10-11)
**Parser Bug Fix: Removed incorrect 0x40 parsing in READ responses**

- **Issue:** Parser was incorrectly scanning for `0x40` bytes and treating following bytes as control IDs
- **Root Cause:** `0x40` appears as **data within `0x48` control structures** (minValue field at offset +7), not as a control marker
- **Impact:** Wrong CC numbers, missing custom labels, fake controls with CC 0
- **Fix:** Removed lines 630-677 from `parseReadResponseFormat` method (Step 3 parsing)
- **Verification:** Only `0x48` markers are used for READ responses, which was already correctly handled in Step 2
- **Reference:** GitHub issue #32

### v1.5 (2025-10-10)
...
```

**Also add clarification in the READ response section:**

Find the section describing READ responses and add:

```markdown
### READ Response Format

READ responses use **only `0x48` control definition markers**. Each control is defined by an 11-byte structure:

```
Position:  0    1          2        3       4        5       6       7         8         9        10
Bytes:     0x48 controlId  0x02     type    channel  param1  0x48    minValue  ccNumber  maxValue  0x00
```

**Important:** The byte `0x40` may appear at position +7 as the `minValue` field. This is **data, not a control marker**.
Do not scan for `0x40` bytes to identify controls.

**Example:**
A control with minValue=64 (0x40) will have `0x40` at byte position +7, immediately before the CC number.
```

#### 2.2 Update `formats/launch_control_xl3.ksy`

**Location:** Version history section (lines 20-25)

**Change:**
```yaml
  Version History:
  - v1.5 (2025-10-11): Documented parser bug fix - 0x40 appears as data in minValue field, not as control marker
  - v1.4 (2025-10-09): Corrected to 2 pages (0x00, 0x03), not 3 pages. Updated to reflect working code.
  - v1.3 (2025-09-30): Documented read slot byte behavior for DAW port integration
```

**Also add comment in control_definition type:**

```yaml
  control_definition:
    doc: |
      11-byte control definition structure found in READ responses.
      Marker byte is always 0x48 (not 0x40, 0x49, or any other value).

      Note: The min_value field (position +7) may contain 0x40 (decimal 64) as DATA.
      This is not a control marker - it's simply a minValue of 64.

      WARNING: Parsers must not scan for 0x40 bytes to identify controls.

#### 2.3 Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Location:** Parser section

**Add note about this bug fix:**

```markdown
### SysExParser

...

#### Common Pitfalls

**DO NOT scan for `0x40` bytes to identify controls in READ responses.**

In versions prior to v1.6, the parser incorrectly scanned for `0x40` bytes and treated following bytes as control IDs.
This was wrong because `0x40` appears as **data within `0x48` control structures** (specifically as the minValue field at byte offset +7).

**Correct approach:** Only look for `0x48` marker bytes to identify control definitions in READ responses.
```

### Phase 3: Testing

#### 3.1 Run Diagnostic Utility

```bash
npx tsx utils/diagnose-jupiter8.ts
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Control 0x17: Expected CC 41/"Encoder 8", Got CC 41/"Encoder 8"
✓ Control 0x18: Expected CC 21/"Resonance", Got CC 21/"Resonance"
✓ Control 0x23: Expected CC 61/"Osc 2 Shape", Got CC 61/"Osc 2 Shape"
✓ Control 0x28: Expected CC 53/"A", Got CC 53/"A"
✓ Control 0x29: Expected CC 54/"D", Got CC 54/"D"
```

#### 3.2 Run Unit Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

**Expected:** All tests pass, no regressions

#### 3.3 Run Round-Trip Tests

```bash
pnpm test:round-trip:node
```

**Expected:** Mode fetch, parse, and write-back all succeed

#### 3.4 Manual Verification

1. Fetch a custom mode with `pnpm backup`
2. Check backup JSON file for correct CC numbers
3. Verify control count matches hardware (48 controls)
4. Verify no fake controls with CC 0

### Phase 4: Cleanup

#### 4.1 Remove Step 1 CC Data Collection (Optional)

**File:** `src/core/SysExParser.ts:562-574`

Since Step 3 is being removed, Step 1 (collecting `ccData`) is no longer needed:

```typescript
// Step 1: Parse any 0x40 CC data sections first (from mixed response)
const ccData: { ccNumber: number, position: number }[] = [];
for (let i = startPos; i < data.length - 1; i++) {
  if (data[i] === 0x40 && data[i + 1] !== undefined) {
    const ccNumber = data[i + 1];
    if (ccNumber !== undefined) {
      ccData.push({ ccNumber, position: ccData.length });
    }
    i++; // Skip the CC number byte
  }
}
```

**Decision:**
- **Option A (Recommended):** Remove this step entirely since it's not used by Step 2
- **Option B:** Keep it but add comment that it's unused (for historical reference)

**Recommendation:** Option A - remove it. Clean code is better than historical artifacts.

#### 4.2 Also Remove Helper Method

**File:** `src/core/SysExParser.ts:683-696`

The `getDefaultColorForControl` method may have been primarily used by Step 3. Check if it's used elsewhere:

```bash
grep -n "getDefaultColorForControl" src/core/SysExParser.ts
```

**If only used in Step 3:** Consider removing it
**If used in Step 2 or elsewhere:** Keep it

### Phase 5: Git Commit

**Commit message:**
```
fix(parser): remove incorrect 0x40 parsing in READ responses (#32)

The parseReadResponseFormat method was incorrectly scanning for 0x40
bytes and treating following bytes as control IDs. In reality, 0x40
appears as data within 0x48 control structures (minValue field at
offset +7), not as a separate control marker.

This caused:
- Wrong CC numbers for some controls
- Missing custom labels
- Creation of fake controls with CC 0

Fix: Remove Step 3 parsing (lines 630-677) which was based on an
incorrect assumption about the protocol. Step 2 (0x48 control parsing)
already correctly handles all controls from READ responses.

Verified against:
- Kaitai Struct specification (formats/launch_control_xl3.ksy)
- Real device testing with Jupiter 8 mode
- Manufacturer's web editor output
