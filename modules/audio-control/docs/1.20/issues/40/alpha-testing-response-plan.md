# Alpha Testing Response Plan: Issue #40 - v1.20.18-alpha.0

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Version:** 1.20.18-alpha.0
**Issue:** #40 - Mode names severely truncated on read-back
**Branch:** `fix/mode-name-18-chars` (commit bb61edc)
**Status:** CRITICAL - Partial success, requires investigation

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### User Report Summary

User completed comprehensive testing of v1.20.18-alpha.0 and reported:

**✅ SUCCESS: Reading (Parsing) Fixed**
- Mode names now parse correctly when reading from device
- All test cases verified: 1, 4, 8, 9, 14-character names work
- Names with spaces parse correctly
- No truncation or padding artifacts

**❌ FAILURE: Writing (Encoding) Still Broken**
- Input: `"Name Test 123"` (14 characters)
- Output: `"Name Tes"` (8 characters)
- Result: **Truncated by 6 characters**

**⚠️ NEW ISSUE: Slot Acknowledgement Error**
```
Error: Write acknowledgement slot mismatch for page 3:
expected slot 4 (status 0x12), but received status 0xd
```
This error did not occur in v1.20.17, suggesting a regression.

### Investigation Finding

**ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED:** Version mismatch between codebase and published package.

**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive investigation completed (documented in `investigation/COMPREHENSIVE-FINDINGS.md`)
- Both bugs identified and fixed in codebase:
  1. Parser pattern fix (line 374-384): Changed from `0x06 0x20` to `0x20`
  2. Encoder length cap fix (line 1123): Changed from 16 to 18 characters
- **Fixes ARE present in commit bb61edc (alpha.0 tag)**
- **But user still experiencing 8-character truncation**

**Hypothesis:** User may have npm cache issue or package didn't publish correctly.

---

## 2. Investigation Findings

### Timeline of Events

**Pre-Alpha Investigation:**
- **2025-10-16:** Issue #40 opened - mode names truncating on read-back
- **2025-10-17 00:00-09:00:** Comprehensive investigation completed
  - MIDI capture analysis (`investigation/midi-captures/`)
  - Code analysis (`investigation/analysis/`)
  - Comprehensive findings documented
- **2025-10-17 09:36:** Implementation workplan created
- **2025-10-17 09:47:** Implementation completed, all integration tests passing
- **2025-10-17 09:50:** Alpha.0 published (commit bb61edc)
- **2025-10-17 16:57:** User testing completed - **parsing works, encoding still broken**

### Code State Verification

**Commit bb61edc (alpha.0 tag) DOES contain both fixes:**

**Fix 1: Parser (lines 374-384)**
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken):
if (data[i] === 0x06 && data[i + 1] === 0x20) {
  const lengthByte = data[i + 2];
  nameLength = lengthByte ?? 0;
  nameStart = i + 3;  // Wrong offset
  break;
}

// AFTER (fixed in alpha.0):
if (data[i] === 0x20) {
  const lengthByte = data[i + 1];
  if (lengthByte === 0x1F) {
    return undefined;
  }
  nameLength = lengthByte ?? 0;
  nameStart = i + 2;  // FIXED offset
  break;
}
```

**Fix 2: Encoder (line 1123)**
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken):
const nameBytes = Array.from(name.substring(0, 16)).map(c => c.charCodeAt(0));

// AFTER (fixed in alpha.0):
const nameBytes = Array.from(name.substring(0, 18)).map(c => c.charCodeAt(0));
```

**Evidence:** Both fixes verified in commit bb61edc via `git show bb61edc:modules/audio-control/modules/launch-control-xl3/src/core/SysExParser.ts`

### Discrepancy Analysis

**Why does user see 8-character truncation if alpha.0 has the 18-character fix?**

**Possible causes:**
1. **npm cache issue** - User's package manager cached old version
2. **Package publication failure** - Build/publish process didn't include changes
3. **Different code path** - xl3-web app might be using different export/import
4. **Build artifact mismatch** - Compiled JavaScript doesn't match TypeScript source

**Evidence supporting hypothesis 1 (npm cache):**
- Parser fix works (parsing uses same SysExParser class)
- Encoder fails (encoding uses same SysExParser class)
- Both functions are in the same file - inconsistent behavior suggests stale code
- User successfully tested with `@oletizi/launch-control-xl3@1.20.18-alpha.0`

**Evidence against hypothesis 1:**
- User specifically installed alpha.0: `@oletizi/launch-control-xl3@1.20.18-alpha.0`
- Parsing works correctly, suggesting new code is loaded
- **If cache issue, both parser AND encoder should fail**

**Most likely cause:** Build/packaging issue where encoder changes didn't make it to published package.

---

## 3. Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Encoding Still Shows 8-Character Truncation

**Impact:** HIGH - Users cannot write mode names longer than 8 characters

**Root Cause:** Unknown - requires investigation

**Evidence:**
- User console log: `[LOG] 6. converted mode name: Name Tes` (8 chars from 14-char input)
- This suggests `substring(0, 8)` behavior, not `substring(0, 18)`
- But alpha.0 codebase HAS the fix: `substring(0, 18)`

**Hypotheses to investigate:**
1. **Build process issue** - Did TypeScript compile to JavaScript correctly?
2. **Export/import issue** - Is xl3-web importing the correct module?
3. **Multiple code paths** - Is there another encodeName function we missed?
4. **Package bundling issue** - Did the build include the right source files?

**Next steps:**
- Verify published package contents on npm
- Check build artifacts in alpha.0 tag
- Compare TypeScript source vs compiled JavaScript
- Test locally with same version string

### Issue 2: Slot Acknowledgement Mismatch (NEW REGRESSION)

**Impact:** HIGH - Write operations fail with slot mismatch error

**Root Cause:** Unknown - this is a NEW error not present in v1.20.17

**Evidence:**
```
Error: Write acknowledgement slot mismatch for page 3:
expected slot 4 (status 0x12), but received status 0xd
```

**Analysis:**
- Error occurs on page 3 (faders/buttons write)
- Expected status: `0x12` (slot 4 in status byte?)
- Received status: `0x0d` (13 decimal)
- This error format suggests validation code checking slot acknowledgements

**Possible causes:**
1. **Protocol change** - Did we inadvertently change write protocol?
2. **Validation logic change** - Did Issue #36 fix affect acknowledgement parsing?
3. **Device state issue** - Is device in unexpected state for slot 4?
4. **Page 3 specific** - Issue only affects faders/buttons page?

**Investigation needed:**
- Review Issue #36 changes (slot selection protocol)
- Check write acknowledgement parsing logic
- Compare alpha.0 vs v1.20.17 write acknowledgement handling
- Verify page 3 write protocol matches pages 0-2

---

## 4. Issues Identified

### Issue 4.1: Encoding Truncation Still Present

**Severity:** HIGH
**Type:** Bug - Incomplete Fix
**Affected Component:** `SysExParser.encodeName()` (line 1122-1132)

**Description:**
Despite code showing `substring(0, 18)` in codebase, published package exhibits `substring(0, 8)` behavior.

**Impact:**
- Mode names limited to 8 characters in write operations
- Device PROTOCOL.md documents 18-character support
- Integration tests pass but real-world usage fails

**Required Investigation:**
1. Download published package from npm
2. Inspect compiled JavaScript in `dist/` directory
3. Verify `encodeName` function in published code
4. Check build process for source mapping issues

**Required Fix:**
- Determine why published package doesn't match source
- Re-publish with correct build artifacts
- Add verification step to release process

### Issue 4.2: Slot Acknowledgement Validation Regression

**Severity:** HIGH
**Type:** Bug - New Regression
**Affected Component:** Write acknowledgement parsing

**Description:**
New error on page 3 writes: slot acknowledgement mismatch.

**Impact:**
- Write operations to slot 4+ may fail
- Page 3 (faders/buttons) specifically affected
- Error not present in v1.20.17

**Required Investigation:**
1. Compare v1.20.17 vs alpha.0 write acknowledgement code
2. Review Issue #36 changes for side effects
3. Check if slot encoding changed in write requests
4. Test with different slots (0-3, 4-8, 9-14)

**Required Fix:**
- Identify change that introduced validation error
- Determine if validation is too strict or protocol changed
- Fix validation logic or write protocol

---

## 5. Proposed Solutions

### Solution 5.1: Verify and Rebuild Package

**Objective:** Determine why published package doesn't match source code

**Steps:**

1. **Verify npm package contents:**
```bash
# Download published package
npm pack @oletizi/launch-control-xl3@1.20.18-alpha.0

# Extract and inspect
tar -xzf oletizi-launch-control-xl3-1.20.18-alpha.0.tgz
cd package/dist
grep -A5 "encodeName" core/SysExParser.js
```

**Expected finding:** JavaScript should show `substring(0, 18)` not `substring(0, 8)`

2. **Check build artifacts in repository:**
```bash
# Inspect dist/ at alpha.0 commit
git show bb61edc:modules/audio-control/modules/launch-control-xl3/dist/core/SysExParser.js | grep -A5 "encodeName"
```

3. **Rebuild locally and compare:**
```bash
git checkout bb61edc
cd modules/audio-control/modules/launch-control-xl3
pnpm build
grep -A5 "encodeName" dist/core/SysExParser.js
```

**If mismatch found:** Rebuild and republish as alpha.1

**If match found:** Issue is in xl3-web app, not library

### Solution 5.2: Fix Slot Acknowledgement Validation

**Objective:** Resolve write acknowledgement mismatch error

**Investigation steps:**

1. **Compare acknowledgement parsing:**
```bash
git diff v1.20.17 bb61edc -- modules/audio-control/modules/launch-control-xl3/src/core/SysExParser.ts | grep -A20 "parseWriteAcknowledgement"
```

2. **Review Issue #36 changes:**
```bash
git log --grep="Issue #36" --oneline
git show [commit] -- modules/audio-control/modules/launch-control-xl3/src/
```

3. **Check write request format:**
```typescript
// Verify buildCustomModeWriteRequest still uses correct slot byte
// Check if page 3 has different expectations than pages 0-2
```

4. **Test with MIDI capture:**
```bash
cd modules/coremidi/midi-snoop
make run
# Capture write operation to slot 4, page 3
# Compare with successful write from v1.20.17
```

**If validation is too strict:**
- Adjust expectations in parseWriteAcknowledgement
- Document actual device behavior

**If protocol changed:**
- Revert breaking change
- Fix write request generation

---

## 7. Testing Strategy

### Before Next Alpha Release

**Critical Tests - MUST PASS:**

1. **Unit test: encodeName with 18 characters**
```typescript
it('should encode 18-character names correctly', () => {
  const encoded = SysExParser['encodeName']('EXACTLY18CHARSLONG');
  expect(encoded[1]).toBe(18); // Length byte should be 18
  expect(encoded.length).toBe(20); // 0x20 + length + 18 chars
});
```

2. **Integration test: Write 18-char name to device (slot 14)**
```bash
npx tsx utils/test-custom-mode-write.ts --name "EIGHTEENCHARSNAME1" --slot 14
npm run backup
cat backup/*.json | jq '.mode.name'
# Expected: "EIGHTEENCHARSNAME1"
```

3. **Integration test: Slot acknowledgement for all slots**
```typescript
for (let slot = 0; slot <= 14; slot++) {
  // Write to each slot, verify acknowledgement
  // Test all pages (0, 3) for each slot
}
```

4. **Package verification test**
```bash
# After build, before publish
npm pack
tar -xzf *.tgz
grep "substring(0, 18)" package/dist/core/SysExParser.js
# Expected: Match found
```

**Nice-to-have Tests:**

5. **Regression test: v1.20.17 functionality preserved**
6. **Edge case: Empty name, 1-char name, 17-char name**
7. **Performance: Write latency within expected ranges**

### Alpha Release Checklist

Before publishing alpha.1 (or alpha.2):

- [ ] Source code verified: `substring(0, 18)` in SysExParser.ts
- [ ] Build completed successfully
- [ ] Dist artifacts verified: `substring(0, 18)` in SysExParser.js
- [ ] Unit tests pass (all 350+ tests)
- [ ] Integration tests pass (5/5 mode name tests)
- [ ] Package contents verified (grep check passes)
- [ ] Slot acknowledgement fix implemented and tested
- [ ] No regressions in v1.20.17 functionality
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated with alpha testing outcomes
- [ ] GitHub issue updated with release notes

### User Testing Instructions

Provide to user with alpha.1+ release:

**Test Case 1: 14-Character Name**
```bash
# Install latest alpha
npm install @oletizi/launch-control-xl3@1.20.18-alpha.1

# In xl3-web app console:
const modeName = "Name Test 123"; // 14 chars
// Create mode with this name
// Write to slot 4
// Read back
// Verify console shows full 14 characters
```

**Expected result:** `converted mode name: Name Test 123` (14 chars, not 8)

**Test Case 2: 18-Character Name**
```bash
const modeName = "EXACTLY18CHARSLONG"; // 18 chars
// Same procedure as Test Case 1
```

**Expected result:** Full 18 characters preserved

**Test Case 3: Slot Acknowledgement**
```bash
// Write to slot 4, page 3
// Verify no acknowledgement mismatch error
```

**Expected result:** No errors, successful write confirmation

```markdown
## Thank You for Alpha Testing!

Your comprehensive testing of v1.20.18-alpha.0 has been extremely valuable. Here's what we found:

### What We Confirmed ✅

- **Reading (parsing) fix is working** - Your tests confirm this
- **Both fixes are present in codebase** - Verified in commit bb61edc
- **Integration tests pass** - All 5 test cases successful in our CI

### The Mystery 🔍

You're seeing 8-character truncation on write, but our code shows the 18-character fix is in place. We're investigating:

1. **Published package verification** - Checking if npm package matches source
2. **Build process review** - Ensuring compiled JavaScript matches TypeScript
3. **Integration point analysis** - Verifying xl3-web app uses correct exports

## 9. Risk Assessment

### Risk 9.1: Published Package Doesn't Match Source

**Likelihood:** HIGH
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Mitigation:** Package verification process (Action 6.1)

**Scenario:** Build process or npm publish failed to include encoder fix

**Consequence:**
- Alpha.1 also shows 8-character truncation
- User confidence reduced
- Additional alpha releases needed

**Mitigation strategy:**
- Implement package verification checklist
- Add automated verification to CI/CD
- Manual inspection before each publish
- Consider automated smoke test against published package

### Risk 9.2: Issue is in xl3-web App, Not Library

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** HIGH
**Mitigation:** Integration point analysis

**Scenario:** Library is correct, but xl3-web imports wrong version or uses wrong build

**Consequence:**
- Library republish won't fix issue
- Need to fix xl3-web app instead
- Longer timeline to resolution

**Mitigation strategy:**
- Verify library package first (Action 6.1)
- If library is correct, shift focus to xl3-web
- Test library directly with node scripts
- Document correct integration patterns

### Risk 9.3: Slot Acknowledgement is Breaking Change

**Likelihood:** LOW
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Mitigation:** Protocol analysis and potential revert

**Scenario:** Issue #36 fix inadvertently changed protocol expectations

**Consequence:**
- Need to revert Issue #36 fix
- Two regressions instead of one fix
- Major protocol issue to resolve

**Mitigation strategy:**
- Careful comparison with v1.20.17
- MIDI capture analysis
- Possible revert and re-approach Issue #36
- Comprehensive protocol documentation update

### Risk 9.4: Multiple Slot/Page Combinations Broken

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** HIGH
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive slot/page testing

**Scenario:** User only tested slot 4, page 3 - other combinations may also fail

**Consequence:**
- Write operations unreliable across all slots
- Need extensive testing matrix
- Multiple fixes required

**Mitigation strategy:**
- Test all slots (0-14) with all pages (0, 3)
- Add integration test matrix
- Document known working combinations
- Prioritize most common use cases

## 12. Lessons Learned (Preliminary)

### What Went Well

1. **Comprehensive investigation before implementation**
   - MIDI capture analysis was thorough
   - Code review identified both bugs correctly
   - Documentation detailed and helpful

2. **Fast response to user testing**
   - User provided excellent testing report
   - Investigation started immediately
   - Communication plan in place

3. **Integration tests caught issues early**
   - Suite 2 tests revealed truncation before user testing
   - Test fixtures from real device captures valuable

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Package verification should be automated**
   - Manual inspection caught discrepancy post-publish
   - Should verify before publish, not after
   - Add to CI/CD pipeline

2. **Alpha testing should happen before publish**
   - User discovered issues we should have caught
   - Need local testing against real device
   - Consider internal alpha before public alpha

3. **Slot acknowledgement regression not caught**
   - Issue #36 changes had unintended side effects
   - Need better regression test coverage
   - Should test all slots/pages combinations

### Action Items for Future

1. **Add package verification to release checklist**
   ```bash
   # Before publish
   npm pack && tar -tzf *.tgz | grep SysExParser.js
   ```

2. **Require device testing before alpha publish**
   - Test with real hardware
   - Verify all common operations
   - Document test results

3. **Expand integration test matrix**
   - All slots (0-14)
   - All pages (0, 3)
   - All acknowledgement types
   - Edge cases (empty names, max length, etc.)
