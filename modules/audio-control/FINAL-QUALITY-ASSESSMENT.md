## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Code Quality Analysis

#### 1.1 Implementation Completeness
**Score: B (80/100)**

| Component | Implementation Status | Line Count | Quality Rating |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|----------------|
| **Maps Tools** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | 2,282 lines | A (Excellent) |
| - `maps:validate` | Fully implemented with comprehensive validation | 640 lines | A |
| - `maps:check` | Complete with health scoring and filtering | 1,017 lines | A |
| - `maps:list` | Full implementation with metadata extraction | 625 lines | A |
| **DAW Tools** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | 936 lines | A- (Very Good) |
| - `daw:generate` | Complete Ardour support, Ableton/REAPER stubs | 519 lines | B+ |
| - `daw:list` | Full implementation with installation detection | 296 lines | A |
| **Workflow Tools** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | 834 lines | A- (Very Good) |
| - `workflow:complete` | End-to-end orchestration implemented | 287 lines | A |
| - `workflow:health` | Comprehensive health checking | 547 lines | A- |
| **Plugin Tools** | ⚠️ **STUBS** | 466 lines | C+ (Fair) |
| - `plugins:extract` | Stub with TODO (critical missing implementation) | 120 lines | C |
| - `plugins:list` | Stub with TODO (missing implementation) | 121 lines | C |
| - `plugins:health` | Basic implementation (acceptable) | 225 lines | B |

**Critical Finding**: Plugin extraction tools (`plugins:extract`, `plugins:list`) are currently stubs with TODOs, but have proper CLI interfaces and error handling.

#### 1.2 TODO Markers Analysis
**Score: C+ (75/100)**

**Found 5 TODO markers requiring attention:**

**HIGH PRIORITY (Affects Core Functionality)**:
1. `tools/plugins/extract.ts:94` - Complete plugin extraction logic missing
2. `tools/plugins/list.ts:95` - Plugin listing implementation missing

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Feature Completeness)**:
3. `tools/daw/generate.ts:116` - Ableton installation detection
4. `tools/daw/generate.ts:125` - REAPER installation detection

**LOW PRIORITY (Enhancement)**:
5. `tools/workflow/health.ts:511` - Automatic fix functionality

**Assessment**: While TODO markers exist, they follow project guidelines by throwing descriptive errors rather than implementing fallbacks. This is architecturally sound.

### 2. TypeScript & Build Quality

- ✅ **Import patterns**: Consistent use of `@/` imports where applicable

**Configuration Issue Identified**: Tools directory needs to be added to `tsconfig.json` references for proper ESLint integration.

#### 2.2 Code Style Consistency
**Score: A (92/100)**

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Consistent CLI argument parsing patterns across all tools
- ✅ Uniform error handling with descriptive messages
