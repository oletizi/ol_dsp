  name: MIDI Channel Registry
  description: Canonical MIDI channel assignments for all plugin mappings on this device
  author: Audio Control System
  date: 2025-09-23
  notes: |
    This registry prevents MIDI channel drift and conflicts by establishing
    canonical channel assignments for each plugin mapping. All plugin mapping
    files should reference this registry instead of defining their own channels.

# Available channels for new plugins: 6-16
available_channels: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]

# Channel allocation guidelines
guidelines:
  - "Channels 1-5: Currently assigned plugins"
  - "Channels 6-16: Available for new plugin mappings"
  - "Channel assignments should be stable across regenerations"
  - "Similar plugin types should be grouped when possible"
  - "Template files (like jupiter-8-base) use generic DAW functions, not plugin parameters"

# Plugin categories and their channel ranges

# Usage instructions
usage:
  lookup_channel: |
    To find the MIDI channel for a plugin mapping:
    1. Look up the plugin path (subdirectory/filename without .yaml) in the channels section
    2. The channel number is the key

  add_new_plugin: |
    To add a new plugin mapping:
    1. Choose an available channel from available_channels list
    2. Add entry to channels section with plugin details
    3. Remove channel from available_channels list
    4. Update plugin mapping file to reference this registry

  prevent_conflicts: |
    This registry ensures:
    - No two plugins use the same MIDI channel
    - Channel assignments remain stable across Ardour map regenerations
    - Easy visibility into channel allocation
    - Clear process for adding new plugins

# Integration notes
integration:
  plugin_files: |
    Plugin mapping files should reference this registry instead of
    defining their own midi_channel field:

    # Instead of: midi_channel: 5
    # Use: midi_channel_registry: ../midi-channel-registry.yaml

    Note: Files in subdirectories should use ../ to reference the registry

  ardour_generation: |
    The Ardour map generation script should:
    1. Load this registry file
    2. Look up each plugin's assigned channel
    3. Use the registry channel instead of auto-assignment
    4. Validate no conflicts exist before generation
