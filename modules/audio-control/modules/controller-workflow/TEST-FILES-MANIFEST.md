## File Verification Evidence

All files verified using Read tool:
- ✓ verify-setup.sh - 65 lines confirmed
- ✓ test-hardware-validation.sh - 201 lines confirmed
- ✓ run-hardware-tests.sh - 37 lines confirmed
- ✓ execute-validation.sh - 90 lines confirmed
- ✓ HARDWARE-TEST-SETUP.md - 283 lines confirmed
- ✓ TEST-FILES-MANIFEST.md - this file

## Execution Flow

```
User runs: ./execute-validation.sh
    ↓
Pre-flight checks (in execute-validation.sh)
    ↓
Calls: ./run-hardware-tests.sh
    ↓
Calls: ./test-hardware-validation.sh
    ↓
Executes 4 test phases:
    1. List configuration slots
    2. Read slot 0 and generate YAML
    3. Validate YAML structure
    4. Deploy to Ardour format
    ↓
Results captured in hardware-test-results.txt
```

## Output Files (Generated During Testing)

After test execution, these files will be created:

```
./output/
├── mode_name.yaml              # Canonical MIDI map
├── mode_name.map               # Ardour XML map
├── test1-list-output.txt       # List command output
├── test2-deploy-output.txt     # Deploy command output
└── test4-ardour-output.txt     # Ardour deployment output

./hardware-test-results.txt     # Complete test log
```

## Test Commands (CLI Invocations)

The test suite executes these commands:

```bash
# Test 1
node dist/cli/deploy.js list

# Test 2
node dist/cli/deploy.js deploy --slot 0

# Test 4
node dist/cli/deploy.js deploy --slot 0 --daw ardour
```

## Quick Start for User

```bash
cd /Users/orion/work/ol_dsp-audio-control-360/modules/audio-control/modules/controller-workflow

# Verify everything is ready
chmod +x verify-setup.sh
./verify-setup.sh

# Run full test suite
chmod +x execute-validation.sh
./execute-validation.sh
```

## Test Coverage

The test suite validates:

1. **Hardware Communication**
   - ✓ USB MIDI device detection
   - ✓ Device connection establishment
   - ✓ SysEx message exchange

2. **Protocol Implementation**
   - ✓ Slot listing (16 slots, 0-15)
   - ✓ Configuration read from slot
   - ✓ Multi-page read handling
   - ✓ Error recovery for failed reads

3. **Data Conversion**
   - ✓ Device format → Canonical YAML
   - ✓ Label preservation
   - ✓ Control type mapping
   - ✓ MIDI channel handling

4. **DAW Deployment**
   - ✓ Canonical → Ardour conversion
   - ✓ XML generation
   - ✓ File output
   - ✓ XML structure validation

## Success Criteria

All tests pass when:
- Device connects successfully
- All 16 slots listed correctly
- Slot 0 configuration read without errors
- Canonical YAML generated with metadata and controls
- Ardour .map file generated with valid XML
