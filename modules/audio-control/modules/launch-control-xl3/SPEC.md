# @oletizi/launch-control-xl3 - Project Specification

*Generated on 9/27/2025*

**Project Type**: cli-tool
**Technologies**: TypeScript, Node.js

**Runtime**: Node.js

## Project Overview

A command-line interface tool for performing specific tasks.

This project uses TypeScript, Node.js, Testing, Vite and follows modern development practices with a focus on
maintainability, performance, and user experience.

### Project Context

- **Name**: @oletizi/launch-control-xl3
- **Type**: library
- **Version**: 1.1.0
- **Language**: TypeScript

## MVP Definition

The MVP includes core interface, basic help system, and essential functionality needed for users to perform primary
tasks.

### Core MVP Requirements

The MVP must include only the essential features required for the project to function and provide value. Advanced
features should be deferred to later phases.

### MVP Success Criteria

- All MVP features are implemented and tested
- Core functionality works end-to-end
- Basic documentation is available
- Project is ready for initial user feedback

## Features and Requirements

### Feature MVP.0

- [x] **Project Setup**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, and development environment
    - [x] Establish project structure and configuration
    - [x] Install and configure essential dependencies

### Feature MVP.1: Multiple Environment Support with a Common API

- [x] The library API supports MIDI communication in node execution environments
- [x] The library API supports MIDI communication in WebMIDI browser execution environments

### Feature MVP.2: Device Handshake

- [x] Library API offers a function to initiate a handshake with the connected device
- [x] Library handshake function successfully listens for and processes the handshake response from the device
- [x] Library handshake function offers well-defined error messages
- [x] Library API offers a function to interrogate the current state of the device connection

#### Feature MVP.2 Testing Requirements

- [x] There is a "one-click" pnpm script in this module that a developer may use to initiates a handshake via Node MIDI
  with a connected device and reports success or failure
- [x] There is an html document that may be loaded into a chrome browser by a developer to initiate a handshake via
  WebMIDI and report success or failure

### Feature MVP.3: Device Custom Mode Fetch

- [x] Library API offers a function to fetch the data from the current custom mode in the connected device
- [x] The fetch function listens for and parses response message(s) from the device and returns a data structure
  representing the custom mode data to the API client
- [x] The fetch function handles empty slots, timeouts, and error cases gracefully

#### Feature MVP.3 Testing Requirements

- [x] There is a "one-click" pnpm script (test:fetch-mode:node) that a developer may use to fetch custom modes via Node
  MIDI with a connected device and reports success or failure
- [x] The test script displays custom mode details including control mappings, LED colors, and labels
- [x] Error handling provides clear troubleshooting guidance for common issues

### Feature MVP.4: Device Custom Mode Send

- [ ] The library API offers a function to send data to update the custom mode in the connected device
- [ ] The fetch function listens for and parses response message(s) from the device and returns a response to the API
  client indicating success or failure
- [ ] The send function handles timeouts and error cases gracefully

#### Feature MVP.4 Testing Requirements

- [ ] There is a "one-click" pnpm script (test:send-mode:node) that a developer may use to send custom mode data via
  MIDI in a node context to a connected device
- [ ] There is also a "one-click" pnpm script (test:round-trip:node) that a developer may use to send custom mode data
  via MIDI in a node context to a connected device; then, on success, it fetches the same data from the connected
  device (via the fetch function) and ensures the fetched data is the same as the sent data

## Feature Prioritization

This project follows an **MVP-first development approach**:

1. **MVP Features**: Core functionality required for minimal viability
2. **Phase 1**: Essential enhancements and user experience improvements
3. **Phase 2**: Advanced features and optimizations
4. **Phase 3**: Nice-to-have features and future considerations

### Development Rules

- MVP features MUST be completed before any Phase 1 features
- Phase 1 features MUST be completed before any Phase 2 features
- No feature can be started if it depends on incomplete features from earlier phases

## Architecture Decisions

### Runtime Environment

Use Node.js as the primary runtime environment

**Rationale:** Provides modern JavaScript runtime with excellent performance and ecosystem support

### TypeScript Adoption

Use TypeScript for all source code

**Rationale:** Provides type safety, better developer experience, and improved code maintainability

### Interface-First Design

Define clear interfaces for all major components

**Rationale:** Promotes loose coupling and makes the system more testable and maintainable

### Composition Over Inheritance

Favor composition patterns over class inheritance

**Rationale:** Reduces complexity and increases flexibility in system design

### Dependency Injection

Use constructor injection for dependencies

**Rationale:** Improves testability and makes dependencies explicit

## Technical Constraints

- **platform**: Code files should not exceed 300-500 lines (Maintains readability and modularity)
- **platform**: All public APIs must be fully typed (Ensures type safety and better developer experience)
- **platform**: No fallbacks or mock data outside of test code (Prevents bugs from being masked by fallback behavior)
- **security**: Security vulnerabilities must be addressed immediately (Protects users and maintains system integrity)

## Acceptance Criteria

### MVP Completion Criteria

- [x] All MVP features are implemented and tested
- [x] Core functionality works end-to-end
- [x] Basic error handling is in place
- [x] Code follows project coding standards

### General Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All features have unit tests where applicable
- [x] Documentation is updated for new features
- [x] No breaking changes to existing functionality (new 4-message protocol implemented cleanly)
- [x] Performance requirements are met (handshake < 1s, custom mode fetch < 3s per slot)
