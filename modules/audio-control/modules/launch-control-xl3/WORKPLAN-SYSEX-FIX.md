ðŸ”§ THE SOLUTION: input.ignoreTypes(false, false, false)

By default, node-midi ignores SysEx messages. The crucial fix was to disable message filtering by calling ignoreTypes(false, false, false) which means:
- Don't ignore SysEx messages
- Don't ignore timing messages
- Don't ignore active sensing messages

âœ… Confirmed Working:
- Read operation returns 434-byte custom mode data
- Mode name parsing: "Digitakt mixer!"
- Control detection: 24 controls found
- Your MIDI capture protocol is 100% correct

ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:
1. Apply this ignoreTypes fix to all our MIDI implementations
2. Update the core NodeMidiBackend class
3. Implement complete custom mode read/write functionality
4. Test write operations with the corrected setup

The mystery is solved - your protocol analysis was spot-on, and the device communication works perfectly once SysEx filtering is disabled!
