# @ol-dsp/launch-control-xl3

TypeScript library for Novation Launch Control XL 3 device control and MIDI mapping.

## Overview

This library provides comprehensive support for the Novation Launch Control XL 3 MIDI controller, including:

- **Device Communication**: Low-level MIDI communication with full protocol support
- **Custom Mode Management**: Read, write, and manage custom device modes
- **SysEx Protocol**: Complete implementation of the XL3 SysEx messaging protocol
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with strict type checking
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for device interaction and debugging

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **This library is currently under active development** ðŸš§

Implementation follows the phases outlined in the [WORKPLAN-LAUNCH-CONTROL-MODULE.md](../../WORKPLAN-LAUNCH-CONTROL-MODULE.md):

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) âœ…
- [x] Module structure initialized
- [x] TypeScript configuration set up
- [x] Build pipeline with Vite configured
- [x] Type definitions for all protocol messages
- [x] Utility functions implemented

### Phase 2: Protocol Implementation (Weeks 3-5) ðŸš§
- [ ] SysEx message parser and builder
- [ ] Midimunge 7-bit encoding/decoding
- [ ] Device identification and initialization
- [ ] Custom mode read/write operations
- [ ] Control mapping system
- [ ] Error handling and recovery

### Phase 3: Data Models & Services (Weeks 6-7) ðŸ“‹
- [ ] CustomMode data model with validation
- [ ] Control model with type safety
- [ ] Template management system
- [ ] Service layer implementation

### Phase 4: CLI Development (Week 8) ðŸ“‹
- [ ] CLI framework with Commander
- [ ] Device connection commands
- [ ] Real-time MIDI monitor
- [ ] Configuration import/export

## Installation

```bash
# Install the package
pnpm add @ol-dsp/launch-control-xl3

# Install peer dependencies
pnpm add midi
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { LaunchControlXL3, createDevice } from '@ol-dsp/launch-control-xl3';

// Note: Full implementation coming in Phase 2
const device = createDevice({
  retryPolicy: { maxRetries: 3, backoffMs: 1000 },
  heartbeat: { intervalMs: 5000 }
});

// Connect to device
await device.connect();

// Read custom mode
const mode = await device.readCustomMode(3);
console.log(`Mode: ${mode.name}, Controls: ${mode.controls.length}`);

// Modify and write back
mode.controls[0].ccNumber = 75;
await device.writeCustomMode(3, mode);
```

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Install CLI globally
pnpm install -g @ol-dsp/launch-control-xl3

# Connect to device
xl3-cli connect

# Read custom mode
xl3-cli read --slot 3

# Write custom mode
xl3-cli write --slot 5 --file my-preset.json

# Monitor MIDI messages
xl3-cli monitor --verbose
```

## Architecture

The library is organized into several key modules:

- **Core**: Low-level device communication and protocol implementation
- **Models**: Data structures for custom modes, controls, and templates
- **Services**: High-level operations and business logic
- **Utils**: Utility functions, validators, and helpers
- **CLI**: Command-line interface tools

## Type Safety

Full TypeScript support with branded types for MIDI values:

```typescript
import { CCNumber, MidiChannel, MidiValue } from '@ol-dsp/launch-control-xl3';

// Type-safe MIDI values
const cc = CCNumber(75);      // Validates 0-127 range
const channel = MidiChannel(1); // Validates 1-16 range
const value = MidiValue(64);    // Validates 0-127 range
```

## Performance

The library is designed for real-time audio applications:

- **< 1ms MIDI message latency**
- **< 100ms device connection time**
- **< 50MB memory usage**
- **Efficient message queuing**
- **Built-in performance monitoring**

## Protocol Support

Complete implementation of the Launch Control XL 3 SysEx protocol:

- Device identification and version detection
- Custom mode read/write operations
- Midimunge encoding for 7-bit safe data transmission
- Checksum validation for data integrity
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms

## Development
